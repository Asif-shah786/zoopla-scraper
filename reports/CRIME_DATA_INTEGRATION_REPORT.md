# Crime Data Integration Report for Zoopla Property RAG App

## üéØ **Why Crime Data Was Needed**

The Zoopla property scraper collects comprehensive property information, but **location safety** is a critical factor for property buyers that wasn't being captured. Crime data provides:

- **Risk Assessment**: Helps buyers understand neighborhood safety
- **Informed Decisions**: Property value and desirability are heavily influenced by crime rates
- **Complete Picture**: Combines property details with area safety metrics
- **Competitive Advantage**: RAG app can answer safety-related queries that basic property listings can't

## üõ†Ô∏è **What We Implemented**

### **Data Source Integration**
- **UK Police API**: Integrated with `data.police.uk` for official crime statistics
- **Geographic Coverage**: 1km radius search around each property's coordinates
- **Time Period**: 6-month rolling window for recent crime trends

### **Smart Summarization System**
- **Traffic Light Rating**: üü¢ Low (0-5), üü° Moderate (6-20), üî¥ High (20+) crime areas
- **Location Context**: Shows actual streets where crimes occurred (e.g., "near Shopping Area")
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies if crime is rising, falling, or stable
- **Category Breakdown**: Highlights main crime types (Violent Crime, Anti-Social Behaviour, etc.)

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures and missing data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API constraints (0.25s between requests)
- **Data Enrichment**: Automatically adds crime summaries to property records
- **CSV/JSON Export**: Flexible output formats for RAG app consumption

## ‚úÖ **How It's Helpful**

### **For Property Buyers**
- **Quick Safety Assessment**: Traffic light system provides instant understanding
- **Detailed Context**: Know which specific areas have issues
- **Trend Awareness**: Understand if area is improving or deteriorating
- **Informed Comparisons**: Compare safety across different properties

### **For RAG App**
- **Enhanced Queries**: Can answer "Is this area safe?" questions
- **Risk Scoring**: Integrate crime data into property recommendations
- **Neighborhood Insights**: Provide comprehensive area analysis
- **Trust Building**: Official police data increases credibility

### **Sample Output**
```
üü¢ New Barton Street: Low crime - 1 incident within 1km radius 
   (near Crosby Road), mainly Other Theft (falling trend)

üî¥ Goldhawk Road: High crime area - 6,268 incidents within 1km radius 
   (near Shopping Area), mainly Violent Crime (falling trend)
```

## üöÄ **Future Improvements**

- **Crime Type Filtering**: Allow users to focus on specific crime categories
- **Historical Trends**: Longer-term crime pattern analysis (1-3 years)

- **Property-Specific Risk**: Calculate actual distance to crime locations

### **User Experience**
- **Interactive Maps**: Visual crime hotspot overlays
- **Safety Scores**: Numerical safety ratings (1-10 scale)
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side safety comparisons
- **Alert System**: Notify users of new crime reports in areas of interest

### **Technical Enhancements**
- **Real-time Updates**: Webhook integration for live crime data
- **Caching Strategy**: Reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Machine Learning**: Predict crime trends based on historical patterns
- **API Fallbacks**: Multiple data sources for redundancy
