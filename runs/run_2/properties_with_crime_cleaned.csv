Framed by open countryside, its glass-roofed conservatory captures sweeping views across rolling fields, while the gardens – a blend of manicured lawns, vibrant borders, and stone pathways – offer peaceful corners to pause and take in the surroundings. The approach sets the scene. A gentle climb along a farm track, edged with open green fields and drystone walls, draws you deeper into rural life. Passing through the working farmyard, the air carries the scent of hay and the occasional sound of livestock, a reminder of the home’s agricultural setting. Beyond the old stone gateposts and cattle grid, the paved driveway and integral double garage mark your arrival at this welcoming home. Where Character Meets Comfort Step inside the covered portico entrance into a bright, contemporary hallway, complete with a handy cloakroom cupboard and direct access to the garage. The warmth of the timber front door, the herringbone flooring, and the overall light and airy feel immediately set the tone – this is a home that respects its heritage while embracing a stylish, modern finish. A Lounge for All Seasons To the left lies the award-winning, magazine-featured lounge – a showpiece of style and comfort. A rustic double-sided stone fireplace with wood-burning stove anchors one wall, adding warmth and character. Soft recessed lighting casts a gentle glow over white walls, oak doors, and the stone-flagged floor that flows throughout the ground floor. Generous picture windows frame the surrounding greenery, creating a connection with the outdoors, while the spacious layout offers the flexibility for cosy evenings or larger gatherings. Integrated ceiling speakers in both the lounge and the kitchen enhance everyday living and entertaining, offering seamless, high-quality audio throughout the social heart of the home Dining with a Sense of Occasion The dining room is full of character, with flagstone flooring under centuries-old oak beams. The double-sided fireplace forms a striking focal point, perfect for lingering over candlelit dinners. A wide picture window overlooks the garden, bringing the changing seasons into every mealtime. Above, the double-height section reveals the oak staircase, complete with cleverly integrated storage beneath, linking the two floors with light and openness. The Heart of the Home – Kitchen &amp; Conservatory The kitchen/breakfast room is designed to be both functional and inviting. Soft grey cabinetry with brushed brass handles pairs with warm wood worktops, while a range-style cooker sits beneath a concealed extractor, framed by rustic herringbone tiling. Integrated appliances include an oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, dishwasher, wine cooler, and a farmhouse-style sink perfectly placed beneath a window to take in the countryside views. A breakfast bar seating four creates the ideal spot for casual dining, morning coffee, or catching up with friends. From here, a door opens to the conservatory – a light-filled space with glass walls and a vaulted roof that blurs the boundary between indoors and out. In summer, it’s bathed in sunshine with garden scents drifting in; in winter, the underfloor heating beneath the tiled floor keeps it warm and inviting, making it a peaceful place to watch frost settle over the fields. French doors lead directly onto the terrace. A useful downstairs WC is located off the kitchen lobby. The garage, also accommodates the washing machine and serves as a practical laundry area, keeping day-to-day chores neatly out of sight. Upstairs – Four Bedrooms and Countryside Calm The oak staircase leads to a vaulted landing filled with light from Velux windows, creating an airy welcome to the upper floor.

The en-suite includes a double shower with glazed screen, vanity sink with mirror, WC, and marble-effect tiling to walls and floor.

Bedroom Three – Overlooking the side garden, decorated in soft pink to half height with a charming exposed beam behind the bed. Bedroom Four – Currently a nursery, with a sage-painted feature wall and a view over the front. A Bathroom Designed for Comfort and Style The family bathroom combines practicality with a sense of luxury. Large marble-effect tiles flow from floor to ceiling, reflecting light beautifully. A wall-hung toilet, contemporary vanity with warm wood countertop, and countertop basin with chrome mixer tap set the scene. An illuminated circular mirror adds soft ambience, complemented by recessed shelving. The bath, with rainfall shower over, invites both quick refreshes and long, indulgent soaks. A chrome heated towel rail and thoughtful design touches complete the space. Gardens and Outlook The gardens are a perfect marriage of open space, mature planting, and uninterrupted views. Lawns sweep around the property, bordered by established shrubs, seasonal flowers, and well-tended beds. A paved terrace alongside the conservatory offers a sunny spot for morning coffee or evening drinks, while stone pathways link different seating areas. A raised planting bed adds colour and structure, and a firepit area provides a cosy place to gather. Climbing plants soften timber and stone boundaries, while hedges offer privacy without interrupting the expansive views. From every vantage point, the rolling hills stretch into the distance – vibrant in summer, golden in autumn, and softly frosted in winter.

These include single storey side and rear extensions aimed at providing proportionate additions to significantly enhance the overall floorspace of the dwelling. The site of Dryfield Cottage is located within the designated Green Belt, where development is very much restricted. As a consequence, the use of ‘permitted development’ (pd) does offer the potential for extensions and the like that otherwise may not be granted planning permission. These provisions (pd) have been influential with regard the plans which have been prepared. Consequently, the extensions are aimed at benefitting from ‘permitted development’ i.e. Elements of these proposals are unlikely to require planning permission. If the development was proposed, as suggested, or variations of such a development, then further discussion would be required as regards the position in respect planning legislation. It would be recommended that a ‘Certificate of Lawfulness’ or ‘Prior Approval’ from Chorley Council should be persued. Further advice can be given in this respect. The extensions, as proposed, are architect designed and seek to sympathetically extend the initial cottage in a contemporary way. The design has specific regard to the relative scale which would result between the existing and proposed, roof profiles, the proportion of the window openings and use of facing materials. The outbuilding proposes ancillary residential provision, including an ensuite bedroom, day/hobbies room and small gym. Alternative residential uses, which would be incidental to the main use of the site for the existing dwelling may well be acceptable. The site plan also includes off street parking. The proposals seek to take full advantage of the site and existing dwelling including maximising views across the site and to the wider landscape, sunlight, and daylight into rooms and maintaining privacy. Further information is available regarding the potential for development on the site can be provided. Agents description A fantastic and rare opportunity to purchase a detached home which is situated within a generous plot of around 0.224 of an acre and located in a very high calibre semi rural location with open fields to the side and rear plus a superb view of Rivington Pike and the surrounding hills. The property would no doubt suit those downsizing from a large home but wishing to retain large gardens and a high quality location. There is also great potential to work with the existing structure and gain planning permission to extend and thus create a house tailored to a buyers own style and specification. Equally, a buyer my consider wholesale redevelopment of the plot where the location can support selling figures in excess of £1M. The current layout includes a lounge and breakfast kitchen to the ground floor and two bedrooms plus bathroom and separate shower room to the first floor. Either the shower room or bathroom could easily be sacrificed to create an additional bedroom. We are advised that the property is Freehold and council tax band E The Area: Dryfield Lane is a highly regarded road in Rivington which is a village just on the outskirts of Horwich. The location blends a rural setting seamlessly with excellent access to facilities and an excellent transport links. The popular and independent Bolton School is around 5 miles away and Dryfield Lane is close to their bus route. Horwich town centre, which includes a good collection of largely independently owned shops and services is under one mile away whilst larger retail outlets can be found towards the Middlebrook development close to the football stadium which includes associated transport links (Horwich Parkway train station on the mainline to Manchester plus junction 6 of the M61). Blackrod train station is physically the closest rail link, is on the main line to Manchester and is around 1.5 miles away whilst the motorway junction is around 3 miles aware. Those busy working in Manchester city centre, for example, would no doubt relish their journey home to a rural retreat to enjoy the country park setting and enviable views. The area is synonymous with the philanthropist Lord Leverhulme who is understood to have socialised with the owners of properties in the area. To enjoy a slice of the towns heritage along with an individual residence and proportionate garden then look no further. This could well be the home for you.

Bumblebee Cottage is one of just four properties within the Hampsons Farm development which is a former working farm now converted to a residential, hamlet style setting. Being the only detached unit adds an additional level of prestige and the commanding plot adjoins open fields. The home was only constructed around 10 to 15 years ago, and therefore combines the rural setting and farm characteristics of stone walls under a slated roof with the benefits of modern construction methods and insulation qualities. The room proportions speak for themselves and there has been a great provision for storage within both the double garage and additional outbuilding. A large driveway caters for a mass of vehicles and also allows for the private storage of motorhomes/caravans etc…. The sellers inform us that the property is Leaseholrd for a term of 999 years from 17.04.2003. Council Tax Band G - £3,568.48 The loft space is for the full footprint and has a ladder The Area: Dwellings of this style are often seen as a 'forever home' type and are seldom placed into the open market and therefore this can be seen as a rare opportunity to acquire such a property. As our clients have mentioned, the location strikes a superb balance of rural surroundings, yet handy transport links and we feel this characteristic will become increasingly important as the inner city and inner town locations become more densely populated. Junction 5 of the M61 is approx 5 miles away and Lostock train station which is on the mainline to Manchester is approx. 3.5 miles away. The area in which the property is situated has recently been purchased by The Woodland Trust who are heavily investing with the restoration and ongoing care of the moors and woodland. We feel this will only enhance what has long been regarded as a high calibre rural retreat. Many people who live in the vicinity consider Manchester and the Trafford Centre an appropriate distance to work, shop and socialise. Closer, there are a great variety of shops and services within Horwich town centre itself and the Middlebrook retail development.

This could be used in a number of different styles be its bedrooms, extended accommodation or an inspirational home office. Historically speaking 54 Church Street was built between 1803 and 1809 by the workers at the ‘Wallsuches Bleach Works’, from the proceeds of a Terminating Building Society, hence the properties are known as Club Houses. Originally No.2 Chapel Street was a bakehouse. The cellar of No.54 was used for cotton handloom weaving and had external access up into Chapel Street. No.54 is the only three-storey house in the area: The attic would have been used as a warehouse for raw materials and finished goods. There once was an interconnecting door from the back bedroom into No.56 and all along the terrace. At the end of the 19th century, No.54 was a pub, the Three Horseshoes. During the early 20th century, the Horwich Town Band practised in the attic; access to the attic was via a fixed ladder and trapdoor from the back bedroom and there was still a partitioned servants’ bedroom in the sw corner with gas lighting. Previous owners converted the 2 houses from flats back into a single dwelling. Since 1988 the house has provided a ground-floor 'Granny Flat’ and accommodation above for a family of five.

A key strength to homes within this area is their ability to provide access into the countryside which is possible to access just past the church. Footpaths lead into the hills that provide an impressive backdrop to the town. Whilst these rural links are so close to hand, the town also functions brilliantly as a commuter belt towards Manchester benefiting from access to several train stations linking to the city, together with junctions 5 and 6 of the M61. The commercial centre itself includes a pleasant range of mainly independently owned shops and services and within around half a mile of the subject property there is childcare at nursery level whilst the town has several primary and secondary schools. The nearby Chorley Old Road is a bus route linking Bolton to Chorley and commercial amenities are enhanced by the Middlebrook retail development which is close to the previously mentioned junction 5 motorway link. The retail park is around 1.5 miles away and includes a wealth of large outlets together with restaurants, cinema, gym etc. All in all, we feel that the area offers a family-friendly package.

The substantial lounge runs parallel with the kitchen to the rear and offers great potential to create open plan living should this be desired. The very fact that the property is situated within a cul-de-sac is a characteristic which should not be underestimated. We have been advised by our vendor that the property is Freehold. Council Tax Band E. The Area: Blandford Rise is a cul- de- sac just off St Leonards Avenue and Purbeck Drive. The development is close to the Beehive roundabout in Lostock and is a well-regarded area. Many people would look to purchase due to the outstanding travel connections which include Horwich Parkway train station and junction 6 of the M61 which are approximately 1.5 miles away. There is popular local schooling with both primary and secondary schools serving the area. From a commercial point of view there is a large out of town style retail development close to the aforementioned train station; whilst Horwich town centre itself is a traditional retail centre with many independently- owned shops and services and is around 2 miles away.

Rural But Not Remote Nestled between the reservoirs of Entwistle and Wayoh and surrounded by fields and countryside, discover The Marl, a lovingly designed home bursting with warmth and character, tucked away at the end of Overshores Road, Turton. A private lane delivers you into the heart of the landscape, and to the gravel driveway of this rural haven, where estate fencing preserves the uninterrupted views of garden and countryside beyond. Once home to an 1800s cottage, The Marl, a handsome home designed to maximise the stunning views out over the fields and reservoirs, stands on this same plot, built in 2011 to offer a balance of traditional living for a modern era. Ample parking is available on the driveway, before making your way indoors, via the oak portico entrance and traditional-style front door. Traditional Home, For Modern Living Light streams into the broad and bright entrance hallway, through windows to either side of the front door. Underfoot, marble tiles gleam, amplifying the sense of light and space. Connecting to all the downstairs rooms, the entrance hall is a destination in itself, and also offers access to an understairs storage area. On hand for guests, a beautifully finished shower room can be found ahead from the front door, tiled in marble and furnished with walk-in shower, wall mounted wash basin and WC. Carpeted in cream, a traditional parlour style sitting room awaits on the right, awash with light courtesy of large windows to either side of the imposing stone fireplace, within which an impactful Chesney’s log-burning stove fills the room with warmth and welcome. Light-filled Living French doors invite further light in, opening to provide instant access out to the garden. A highlight of The Marl, you needn’t leave the comfort of your seat to soak up the stunning views out over the fields and water. Double doors open up to the left of the entrance hall, where formal feasting can be enjoyed in the traditional dining room, a spacious room with a peaceful ambience, overlooking the drive via a bay window. Warmth emanates from the corner fireplace, furnished with a Stovax log burner. Also opening up on the left from the entrance hall is a second family sitting room, with a cosy corner stone fireplace housing an inset log burner, filling the room with cosy warmth. Marble tiling flows underfoot, making this the perfect family room, practical too for pets. With four, fantastically sized reception rooms available at The Marl, there is great flexibility to redefine the rooms to suit your own needs, substituting sitting or dining room for play room, cinema room or snug. Feast Your Eyes Ahead from the entrance hall and to the right, feast your eyes on the impressive Stuart Fraser Siematic kitchen. A host of integrated appliances include four Neff ovens (microwave, steam and two conventional), Neff dishwasher, Samsung American-style fridge-freezer and an induction hob within the central island breakfast bar, which also features an undermounted sink with Quooker instant boiling tap.

The plot is just over half an acre, and it is generally a level site and is of a regular shape. Many years ago, the family purchased an additional strip of land and so there is a greater width when compared to some similar homes within the vicinity. Main services are connected, and our clients have also acquired the freehold. The current dwelling is a four bedroom detached which in itself is a pleasant size but equally modest when compared to some of the more recently constructed properties along the road. As such, we are happy to report that our clients have gained detailed planning to construct a ‘super home’ of 10,000 ft.². As such, the lengthy and costly legwork has been completed and establishes a remarkable concept. If a buyer wished to create a smaller dwelling, this should therefore be achievable subject to the usual consents. As you will see, there are a number of CGI images to illustrate the proposed build and no doubt the buyer who presents will have a desire to create a high calibre bespoke home safe in the knowledge that the postcode supports high value transactions.

The high calibre address sits within the heart of Lostock and hosts large individual dwellings, many of which boasting a significant value. As such a buyer can be comfortable in the knowledge that the tone of value within the immediate area is at a high level. Many people would wish to settle in the area to benefit from the outstanding transport infrastructure which includes junction 6 of the M61 (around 2 miles away) and Lostock train station (around1 mile away) which is on the mainline to Manchester. Bolton School is also a consistent reason for residents to settle within the area and it is worth noting that a bus route runs along the nearby Chorley New Road and that the school is just around 2 miles away. In terms of shops and services, Horwich town centre and the Middlebrook leisure and retail development include a great variety of outlets from small independent traders to large supermarkets, whilst many locals consider Manchester as an appropriate distance to shop, work and socialise. There is a choice of 2 golf clubs practically on the doorstep with a further variety of gyms and racquet clubs which serve the area.

Whilst the property had been well cared for during the lengthy ownership, aesthetically and layout wise the home was dated and subsequently a significant program of modernisation has taken place with a reconfiguration and an extension having now been completed. The result is a stunning home with modern curb appeal by way of double apex roofline, neutral rendering and anthracite windows. The driveway has been enlarged to accommodate family sized parking whilst the garage has been retained. There is scope for further conversion should additional ground floor space or bedroom be required. The two primary bedrooms with their vaulted ceilings should allow this home to stand out from the crowd. This truly is one not to be missed and an early viewing is recommended. The property is Freehold Council Tax is Band F - £3,318.18 The Area: Morris Fold Drive is located just off Regent Road which is located within the heart of Lostock and is seen by many as one of the more prestigious roads within the area. A particularly strong feature of the road is access to Lostock train station which is around 0.3 miles away and links to Manchester and its airport. Lostock County Primary School is just a few minutes from the property and the train station itself and many people buy within this area seeking good access to the private schooling on offer within the town (Bolton School is just over 2 miles away). Whilst the train station is well placed, Junction 5 and 6 of the M61 are also easily accessible. The closest commercial centre is within the out-of-town retail complex close to the Toughsheet Community Stadium at the Middlebrook retail complex which includes a number of supermarkets and large outlets together with gym, bowling alley, cinema, restaurants etc. There are also two golf courses and a tennis club within easy walking distance. Many locals also consider Manchester and the Trafford Centre as an appropriate distance for both socialising and work. Whilst many of these features are ideal for living within a commuter belt of a large city, the town also boasts very popular countryside including a stretch of the West Pennine Moors and Winter Hill.

A home filled with rich history, that is of the land, Holme Fold Farm is a true character home, brimming with original features including centuries’ old, exposed beams. Dating back to 1830, this former farmhouse has so much potential; with spacious rooms, a studio annex and two independent cottages, its flexibility is limitless – from family home with ample guest accommodation to hotel, farm, smallholding, lifestyle business; the versatility of the buildings and 2.7 acres of land cannot be underestimated. A warm welcome Pull through the bespoke iron gates and along a lengthy driveway, where there is ample parking for at least six cars, before making your way to the porch entrance, where a multifuel stove provides a buffer of warmth as you step indoors away from the elements. To the right, make your way into the sitting room, where an incredible carved wood and redbrick original fireplace houses a gas fire. Currently used as a study, this cosy room features handsome exposed beams to the ceiling, with quality, hardwearing carpet underfoot. On windy days, shut the door to the world and feel the solidity of the thick stone walls, retaining warmth in winter and keeping a cool interior in the summer months. Wine and dine Opening up from the sitting room is the dining room, where a traditional look, real-flame gas fire adds rustic glow. Deep set windows frame views out over the courtyard whilst beams overhead – sourced from ancient ships – infuse this characterful room with olde worlde warmth. Conveniently connected to the dining room, follow the easy flow of Holme Fold Farm through to the kitchen, where original flagstone flooring adds authentic farmhouse charm underfoot. Practical and robust, this flooring is perfectly in keeping with the country-style cabinetry that surrounds, providing plenty of storage. Traditional touches Overhead, in the white painted beams, original meat hooks can still be spied. With plenty of space for freestanding appliances beneath the solid oak worktops, there is ample potential to update this kitchen, with scope to open it up to the studio apartment beyond, creating a modern open-plan dining-kitchen. Views extend over the cobblestone courtyard, filled with colour and planted with flowers, trees and shrubs. Ideal for family living, room leads on from room at Holme Fold Farm, with the kitchen conveniently connecting to the front lounge. A superbly sized family room, modern spotlighting balances against the original beams inlaid within the ceiling above. Warmth fills the room from the stove, set within a handsome exposed redbrick surround, whilst views extend over the front garden. Bedtime beckons Completing the loop of the home, ascend the stairs from the sitting room to arrive on the upstairs landing, where recently fitted pale grey carpets harmonise with the white walls for a calming feel. On the left, discover bedroom four, a good-sized double bedroom offering incredible views over the front of the home, with fields unfurling as far as the eye can see. A sunny, south-facing room, catch the sunrise and sunsets from this bedroom, and spy deer roaming the dew-covered meadows. Freshen up in the bathroom opposite, beautifully proportioned and furnished with a traditional clawfoot bathtub, shower, wash basin with traditional taps and WC. Resin flooring, impervious to water, is practical underfoot. Pale grey and white tones mingle with rustic black beams. Coming out of here, turn right to arrive at bedroom three, another good size double framing views out over the courtyard. Room for all Opposite, the largest bedroom awaits, bright and airy, and following the same soothing grey and white decorative motif as the preceding bedrooms. Furnished in traditional fashion, this bedroom is a true sanctuary. Further along the landing, sneak a peek at the fitted storage, before arriving at bedroom two on the left, a room with ample storage and served by its own shower room ensuite. Overlooking the courtyard to the rear, also furnished with a soothing shower room ensuite, is a sixth bedroom. Dressed in white and grey, each bedroom and bathroom has its own fresh, contemporary feel. Rental potential With six bedrooms and so much space in the main home, consider the potential of the studio one-bedroom annex, one-bedroom cottage and two-bedroom cottage which also come with Holme Fold Farm; each furnished with bathroom, lounge and kitchen. Ideal as overspill accommodation for large families, for Airbnb rental or even as self-contained business units, the potential is vast. Outdoor living Outside, a coal shed and cycle shed provide plenty of storage (an old-fashioned door in the rear garden, once used for coal deliveries is a hint to the 1800s origins of the home). Six areas of garden provide different pockets of privacy in which to relax, unwind and appreciate the peaceful rural setting of Holme Fold Farm. Perfect for children’s games, a formally planted area accompanies a picnicking area with bench seating. Wildlife is in abundance, encouraged by mature trees and hedging, which also provide privacy and shelter. Owner quote: “You could have your own swimming pool, gym or llama farm; all the potential is there.” Make your way to the 2.72-acre field, a sufficient size for two horses, and survey the sublime surroundings. Observe the 320-degree open country views, taking in the distinct beauty of six counties, including snow-capped moorlands and sunny meadows. Watch the new year fireworks beneath a blanket and with a flask of mulled wine. Additional outbuildings include a barn currently used for storage and a large shipping container, used as a lock up. On your doorstep Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside at Holme Fold Farm, surrounded by fields and where at night you can sit out and hear the bats flitting about, replaced by the piercing cries of buzzards in the daytime. Rurality and refuge come replete with convenience and connectivity, with five supermarkets close by, the nearest only eight minutes away. Dip into the hustle and bustle of the world with a trip to the cinema, only 15 minutes’ drive from the door, whilst the Middlebrook Retail Park is just over ten minutes’ drive away. Families are well served by a plethora of local primary, state and secondary schools, whilst the independent Bolton School is also less than 15 minutes’ drive away. Commute with ease; the motorway junction is only five minutes from the door – though you’d never know it. The vast greenery of Great Lever and Farnworth Golf Club provides a buffer between Holme Fold Farm and the Royal Bolton Hospital – a mere five or so minutes’ drive away. Owner quote: “One minute you’re in a semi-rural world; the next you can be in suburbia surrounded by modern life.” For those who love character properties and are looking for the flexibility to build their own life around them, Holme Fold Farm is a versatile oasis of calm, wherein you can escape the inflexibility of modern life. Not just a home, it’s a lifestyle; and it’s ready for its next adventure.

The Heart of the Home Flowing from the second reception room, the kitchen-diner is both charming and practical. Cream in-frame cabinetry is topped with oak-style worktops, complemented by blue, grey, and cream splashback tiles. Integrated Bosch appliances — oven, halogen hob, extractor, dishwasher, fridge and freezer — provide all the modern conveniences, while oak laminate flooring adds warmth underfoot. With space for a dining table and plenty of worktop area, this is a kitchen built for both weekday routines and weekend feasts. Sleep, Retreat, Repeat Upstairs, four double bedrooms await — each a peaceful escape from the everyday. The main bedroom offers a sanctuary feel, with grey panelled wardrobes, matching bedside cabinetry, and a large front-facing window that fills the room with morning light. Bedroom two, also front-facing, is light and airy with crisp white walls and the bonus of a shower tucked cleverly into the corner. Bedroom three boasts dual-aspect windows framing far-reaching views — perfect for stargazing or sunrise watching — while bedroom four offers built-in wardrobes and space for a double bed beneath the window. A family bathroom completes the upper floor, fitted with a full-length bath and overhead shower, WC, and pedestal basin, framed with marble-effect wall panels for a sleek, low-maintenance finish. Space to Create, Work or Escape Once a garage, now a beautifully transformed home office, the detached outbuilding is a triumph of purpose and design. Split-level flooring, white and teal tones, and grey herringbone laminate make this a stylish spot to work, exercise, or create. Whether you’re working from home, running a business, or seeking a studio space, this versatile building adapts to your needs with ease. This home already offers so much for a growing family, yet the potential for further development is undeniable. Subject to the necessary planning and building regulations, there’s scope to extend into the loft—imagine waking up to stunning views from a brand-new dormer window. The kitchen, too, could easily be reimagined into a striking open-plan space with a central island—perfect for modern family living. When you consider that newly built four-bedroom detached homes nearby are fetching close to £500,000, this property presents a rare and valuable opportunity. One not to be missed. Garden Views That Steal the Show Set on a corner plot, the rear garden is a private, low-maintenance oasis — with not one, but two paved patio areas connected by a neat pathway, a lush lawn, and a grey-painted timber fence for privacy and security. Children and pets will have room to roam, while adults can savour sundown drinks against a backdrop of stunning, uninterrupted views. The garden is a canvas, ready for your own touches. A Location to Love Located on the well-regarded Horseshoe Lane in Bromley Cross, this detached family home offers spacious living, panoramic views, and unbeatable access to local amenities. From outstanding schools to countryside walks, everything you need is right on your doorstep. Everything you need is nearby — from Bromley Cross train station offering direct links to Manchester, to local favourites like Earthlings café, Cibo restaurant, and a selection of pubs and shops including Co-op and Sainsbury’s. Nature lovers will appreciate the close proximity to Jumbles Reservoir, Dunscar Woods, and the moors around Turton Tower. The Last Drop Village and Turton Golf Club sit just across from the end of the road, offering spa days, dining, and leisure right on your doorstep. Families benefit from walking-distance access to top local schools including Eagley Infants and Juniors, St John’s, and Turton High. With strong road and rail links, peaceful surroundings, and a welcoming community, Horseshoe Lane is a location that truly delivers.

With beautifully landscaped gardens, spacious interiors, and a prime location just a short walk from Bolton School, this elegant home offers the perfect blend of comfort, class, and convenience. Set Back and Secluded Beyond the private gates of Oak Coppice, this handsome home sits proudly behind a double-width driveway complete with an EV charger and a neatly manicured lawn. The double garage offers ample parking and internal access. As you step inside the front door, a wide and welcoming hallway sets the tone — complete with warm wood-effect tiled flooring, a glazed oak balustrade staircase, and subtle wallcoverings that instantly evoke a sense of refinement. To your left, a cleverly designed cloakroom/WC is neatly tucked away — practical, yet beautifully styled for guests. Spacious &amp; Versatile Living To the right of the hall, light pours into the generous full-depth lounge from both the front-facing window and the French doors opening onto the rear garden. A central fireplace anchors the room, while wallpapered feature walls and coordinating curtains with pelmets add a refined softness. This is a room designed for both family downtime and sophisticated evening entertaining. At the end of the hallway, through double oak doors, you’ll find the formal dining room. Overlooking the garden and styled in complementary tones to the lounge, it’s a versatile space just as suited to Sunday roasts as it is to celebratory dinners. Work, Read, Retreat Also on the ground floor, a dedicated study offers a quiet, focused workspace away from the main social areas. Fitted with bespoke shelving and a built-in desk, it’s ideal for remote working, student study, or simply enjoying a moment of calm with a good book. The Heart of the Home The rear of the property opens up into a stunning open-plan kitchen and family dining area. Modern grey woodgrain shaker-style units pair seamlessly with Corian worktops and a statement central island, complete with seating for four, an integrated wine cooler, induction hob, and overhead stainless steel ceiling-mounted extractor. Whether you're hosting drinks, helping with homework, or rustling up dinner, this space brings everyone together. A cookbook shelf and clever storage keep the aesthetic clean and curated, while two integrated Neff ovens, a fridge, freezer, and dishwasher cater to busy family life. A touchless sink tap, metallic mosaic splashback, and diagonally laid wood-effect tiles add stylish, contemporary flair. Sliding patio doors draw the eye toward the landscaped garden, filling the kitchen with natural light and linking indoor comfort with outdoor calm. Off the kitchen, a large utility room offers plumbing for a washing machine and tumble dryer, space for a freestanding fridge-freezer, additional cupboards, and side access — keeping life organised and laundry out of sight. Five Double Bedrooms Upstairs, the airy landing leads to five generous bedrooms — each tastefully decorated and ready to move straight into. The main bedroom, looking out to the front, features bespoke fitted wardrobes with sliding frosted and mirrored doors and a feature wall in Morris &amp; Co’s wallpaper in soft sage. Its en suite bathroom is a contemporary haven, with marble-style tiling, a walk-in shower with black fixtures, back-to-wall WC, gloss blue wall-hung vanity unit, illuminated mirror, and a sleek black heated towel rail. Bedroom two, overlooking the rear garden, is neutrally decorated with stylish panel detailing and built-in wardrobes — ideal for teens or guests. Bedroom three mirrors the chic panelling style of bedroom two and enjoys peaceful views over the rear garden. Bedroom four is neutrally decorated and features fitted wardrobes, making it a bright and versatile space for guests, children, or a dedicated dressing room. Bedroom five, currently set up as a second home office, features a bold teal accent wall and offers plenty of flexibility — equally ideal as a creative studio, a cosy bedroom, or a quiet retreat. Stylish Family Bathroom Serving the remaining bedrooms is a luxurious four-piece family bathroom. A gloss white vanity unit, back-to-wall WC, glazed shower enclosure, and a jacuzzi bath with chrome fixtures provide all the essentials — while the feature three-tone grey tiling and chrome heated towel rail offer a touch of spa-like luxury. A Private Outdoor Escape The beautifully landscaped rear garden is a true private haven, framed by mature trees and lush hedging that offer both seclusion and tranquillity. A sweeping curved Indian stone patio runs the full width of the home, flowing effortlessly up to a raised decked area beneath a charming gazebo – complete with lighting and space for an outdoor heater for year-round enjoyment. To the rear, there’s a designated space primed for an outdoor kitchen, with built-in units and bench seating perfect for a BBQ or even a pizza oven setup. Whether you’re hosting summer soirées or enjoying a quiet morning coffee, this space is designed for al fresco living. A step down leads to a neatly kept lawn – ideal for children to play or simply to relax and unwind in peace.

The property is Freehold. Oak Coppice is a privately managed gated development with its own drainage system and shared communal responsibilities. Residents contribute £175 per quarter toward maintenance of shared areas, including the road, electric gates, and street lighting. In addition, there is a £400 annual contribution to a communal sinking fund to cover long-term upkeep. The development is overseen by the Oak Coppice Residents Association, in which each homeowner holds an equal share. The roles of Director and Secretary are held by residents and are rotated annually. An Annual General Meeting takes place each December to ensure collaborative and transparent management. Agent notes: Important Notice for Buyers We do our best to make sure our property details are accurate and reliable, but they do not form part of any offer or contract and should not be relied upon as statements of fact. Measurements, photographs, floor plans, and any services or appliances listed are for guidance only — they may not be exact or tested. Some photographs may include virtually staged furnishings and décor intended to illustrate potential layouts or styling. Fixtures &amp; Fittings Any fixtures and fittings not specifically mentioned in the property details should be agreed separately with the seller. Anti-Money Laundering (aml) &amp; Buyer id Checks To comply with legal requirements, we must verify the identity of all buyers before we can move forward with a sale. We’ll also need proof of funds and details of your instructed solicitor at this stage. At Newton &amp; Co, we use a trusted third-party provider to complete these checks securely and quickly. There’s a small, non-refundable fee of £25 per person (or £50 if you’re buying through a company), which is paid directly to us when you’re ready to proceed. Please note, we can’t issue a memorandum of sale until these checks are complete — so the sooner they’re done, the sooner we can help you secure your new home. Relationship Disclosure In line with Section 21 of the Estate Agents Act 1979, we must declare if the owner of a property is related to anyone at Newton &amp; Co. If that’s ever the case, we’ll always let you know. Referral Fees We may recommend trusted partners for extra services you might need — such as conveyancing, mortgage advice, insurance, or surveys. Sometimes we receive a small referral fee for introducing you to these providers. You’re under no obligation to use them and you’re always welcome to choose your own.

It is important to note that there has historically been a driveway to the rear together with the garden area although more recently our clients have opted to use the outside space purely as a garden. The ability to create off road parking is an important and increasingly in demand feature. The generous layout includes a porch projection to the front which is ideal for storing outdoor coats and shoes etc and the lounge is configured with an open plan staircase which increases the sense of size, space and light. To the rear there is a modern dining kitchen which overlooks and opens to the rear garden and to the first floor there are three bedrooms two of which are a good double size. Please note that the third bedroom is larger than a typical box room. The modern shower room is positioned to the rear and there is also potential for storage within the loft. We feel the property would suit first time buyers, those downsizing from a larger property and buy to let investors. The convenient location will no doubt suit those buyers looking for easy access to the popular shops and services within the nearby town centre.

Additionally, around 3 miles away, there is access to an out-of-town style retail development which in addition to the usual commercial facilities includes the likes of a cinema, bowling alley and large restaurants etc. The countryside is also a very strong feature of the town and access is provided into a stretch of the West Pennine Moors and the Rivington Country Park.

A particularly strong characteristic is the setting itself which is a low density cul de sac with properties located on just one side of the road, meaning that the subject property enjoys an open aspect to both the front and rear. This characteristic is seldom associated with the immediate area. The rear garden has been thoughtfully landscaped and boasts a lower-level patio sitting alongside a natural stream and overlooking woodland.

The master bedroom includes an en suite with the further 3 bedrooms being served by the main family bathroom. There are further family-friendly characteristics such as a large integral double garage, separate utility, ground floor WC and there is excellent potential to extend above the garage area should larger first floor accommodation be needed in due course.

Welcome to Harvey Street—a hidden gem nestled at the very end, near Hill Top—where this captivating Grade II Listed end-stone cottage waits to write its next chapter with you. The First Glimpse As you approach the cottage, a timeless stone wall and gated pathway draw you in. To your right, a manicured artificial lawn is softened by the shade of a graceful tree, while vivid red blooms climb the cottage’s stone façade like something from a postcard. A cream-painted timber door invites you inside—an elegant nod to the home’s history, framed by classic mullioned, leaded windows and aged stone lintels that speak of stories past. Step Inside Enter the dining room—a space that whispers warmth and welcome. Exposed timber beams crown the ceiling above soft white walls, while engineered oak flooring stretches out beneath your feet. A fireplace, topped with a chunky wooden lintel and ready for an electric fire, creates a cosy heart to gather around. This room is spacious enough for dinner parties and family breakfasts alike, with open archways either side of the chimney breast drawing you through into the lounge. In the lounge, there’s space for an L-shaped sofa, perfectly positioned beneath a wall-mounted TV point. Mullioned windows to both front and side elevations let natural light flood in. A stable door—quintessentially cottage—opens directly onto the side garden, blending indoor comfort with outdoor charm. Beyond the lounge, double doors reveal a snug—a third reception room currently used as a playroom. A large side window keeps it bright, while a doorway leads seamlessly through to the kitchen, which loops back around to the dining room for a fluid, family-friendly layout. The Heart of the Home In the kitchen, rustic elegance meets contemporary comfort. Cream Shaker-style units and drawers offer ample storage, topped with warm oak effect worktops. A stainless steel oven and 5-ring gas hob sit beneath a matching extractor, with glazed tile splashbacks adding subtle texture. Integrated appliances include a fridge, and freezer, while a stainless steel sink and drainer enjoy leafy views through one of two rear-facing windows. Upstairs Escape Climb the stairs—framed by characterful timber doors with traditional latch ironmongery—to find three generously sized bedrooms. The main bedroom looks out over the front garden, bathed in light from its mullioned windows. Decorated in soft whites, with original ceiling beams and space for a full suite of furniture, it’s both calming and grand. A charming original grate in the chimney breast adds a touch of vintage romance, paired beautifully with cosy wool carpeting. The second bedroom, also front-facing, is painted in soothing scalloped teal and white with sleek laminate flooring. The third bedroom at the rear is a peaceful retreat, offering woodland views and a neutral palette—ideal for a nursery, guest room, or creative hideaway. Spa-Like Serenity Serving the bedrooms is a beautifully finished bathroom with a modern dual WC and vanity storage, a panelled bath, and a separate shower enclosure. White tiles meet a feature wallcovering, and contemporary touches like a black heated towel rail and stainless steel fittings complete the look. Conveniently tucked on the same floor is a dedicated laundry room—no more lugging laundry downstairs—with room for a dryer, a second WC, and wall-mounted basin. A modern boiler, installed less than two years ago, is fully serviced and still under warranty for added peace of mind. Alfresco Living Step outside and discover a surprisingly spacious south-east facing garden. To the side, a paved patio is perfect for summer BBQs or morning coffee. A further paved area offers room for play equipment, while planted stone beds stretch along the fence line, bursting with life. A greenhouse and painted brick outbuilding provide practicality and charm, all enclosed within traditional dry-stone walls. The outbuilding is a former wwi air raid shelter, originally built for the local area and now forming part of the property — adding a fascinating layer of historical context. Explore the Area Harvey Street places you on the fringe of open countryside, yet within easy reach of everything. Walk the dog or enjoy a picnic at Moss Bank Park, just minutes away, or follow the West Pennine Way from nearby Barrow Bridge for panoramic walks through Smithills Woods. Right across the road, Tootle Park offers an open green space for everyday strolls or weekend games. You’re well connected too—with bakeries, cafés, supermarkets, post offices, and more just a short drive away. Local favourites like The Bob Smithy pub or Bake and Roast at historic Smithills Hall are on hand for cosy nights out or Sunday brunch. And for commuters, reliable bus routes into Bolton and Horwich are just moments from your door.

Nearby, a walk-in double shower with seamless glass enclosure offers a luxurious everyday escape, while a floating vanity unit and soft, ambient lighting add to the sophisticated atmosphere.

Surrounded by open fields and country lanes, Corner House is a home where nature meets practicality. Morning light floods the interior, evening skies stretch over garden walls, and every window offers a quiet nod to the countryside beyond. An Inviting First Impression Discreetly set back from the road, the entrance is tucked privately to the rear, where a porch laid with Moroccan-style tiles sets a warm, creative tone. From here, step into the heart of the home: A wide reception hallway adorned with rich oak timber flooring and calming putty-pink walls. This hallway connects the home with grace and flow, guiding you first to a convenient downstairs cloakroom—complete with wall-mounted basin and WC—offering comfort and privacy for guests. A Lounge Made for Living Turn into the lounge, and you’ll find a generous space filled with natural light from windows to both the front and side. Soft green-blue walls embrace you, while a log-burning stove promises cosy evenings curled up with a book or gathered with friends. There’s space here not just for a full suite of seating, but for a piano too—making it a room that invites both quiet moments and shared celebrations. Beyond the window, fields roll out into the distance, grounding you in the home’s rural setting. Where Cooking Meets Connection The kitchen-diner is a charming and functional centrepiece. White gloss cabinetry in an L-shaped layout is topped with warm timber worktops, while a contemporary splashback adds style and edge. A built-in electric oven and four-ring halogen hob sit beneath a sleek black extractor, while an integrated dishwasher, plumbing for a washing machine, and space for an American-style fridge-freezer (with water connection) ensure convenience.

The main bedroom is a sanctuary in denim blue, with a feature geometric wallcovering and soft lighting creating a restful atmosphere. White-painted timber ceiling beams nod to the property’s character, while a walk-in storage closet and stylish ensuite—featuring a vanity basin with blue cabinetry, WC, and a spacious glazed shower with slate tiling—add modern luxury. Bedroom two is currently styled as a child’s room, with playful robot-themed wallpaper to one wall and a built-in closet for practical storage. A soft blue palette makes the space both calming and fun. Bedroom three is full of light thanks to its triple aspect windows, and its bold navy walls, matching timber flooring, and built-in storage make it a sophisticated space for guests, teens, or as a creative studio. Bedroom four is sweetly styled with pink and grey geometric wallpaper, offering the same oak-toned flooring and generous proportions found throughout—proof that every room here is a double in disguise. A Bathroom with Vintage Charm The family bathroom blends space and tradition with a five-piece suite that includes a corner bath, pedestal sink, bidet, WC, and separate corner shower. Classic blue and white tiling with decorative borders wraps the room in gentle character, offering a nostalgic, timeless atmosphere that’s both practical and charming. A Garden Made for Living Step outside to a beautifully enclosed garden—a safe and sun-filled retreat for children, pets, and alfresco living. A large stone-paved patio is made for summer dining or morning coffee, while an artificial lawn ensures ease and colour all year round. Bordered by a mix of stone walling and fencing, the garden enjoys privacy and far-reaching views of open countryside. To the rear and side, practical access for parking completes the picture. A Location That Has It All Despite its peaceful setting, the home is just minutes from Tottington, Walshaw, and Harwood villages, where you’ll find local shops, well-regarded pubs and restaurants, and everyday amenities. Bury town centre is only a five-minute drive away. Enjoy countryside walks up to The Pack Horse in Affetside, or explore local favourites such as Baci, Carmello’s, Rapallo, The Victoria, and The White Horse. Harwood Golf Course is just down the road, offering more opportunities for recreation and socialising. A Hidden Gem Between Village and Valley Corner House is more than a home—it’s a way of life. With its generous interiors, enchanting setting, and deceptively spacious layout, it offers comfort, connection, and a daily dose of countryside calm. Whether you're stepping into village life for the first time or looking to slow the pace while staying connected, this home invites you to write your next chapter somewhere truly special.

From its manicured frontage to its sun-drenched garden retreat, every inch of this property whispers comfort, space, and style. First Impressions That Last The approach to this home is charming and inviting, with a gently sloped block-paved driveway, crisp landscaping, and a warm, contemporary façade. A spacious integral garage provides convenience and storage, with a 2.1 meter high remotely controlled rollover door, while the bold front door welcomes you into a home designed for both family life and sophisticated entertaining. Living Spaces That Breathe Step into a beautifully proportioned living room at the front of the house — an inviting retreat ideal for cosy evenings or weekend movie marathons, complete with a gas fire set in a handsome stone surround and the comfort of underfloor heating. Venture further and the heart of the home unfolds: An impressive open-plan family/dining/living space that dazzles with volume and light. Vaulted ceilings soar above, punctuated by striking triangular windows, while dual-aspect bi-fold doors blur the boundaries between inside and out, opening to both sides of the landscaped garden. Character features such as exposed oak beams and a crisp white wall finish bring warmth and charm, while herringbone greyed-oak flooring adds a contemporary edge, flowing seamlessly into the kitchen. Thoughtful touches such as remotely controlled, concealed LED lighting above the roof beams enhance the ambiance after dark. Outside, a range of lighting options—including soffit and wall lights, concealed LED strips outside the lounge, and spotlights illuminating the trees—create a magical nighttime setting, bringing the outdoors in even during the winter months. A Kitchen for Gatherings Centrally located, the sleek, elongated kitchen is both practical and stylish. Fitted with pristine white cabinetry and striking black granite worktops that sweep around to form a sociable breakfast bar, it’s designed for effortless hosting and everyday ease. Integrated appliances include a built-in oven and grill, dishwasher, fridge, freezer, wine cooler, and an induction hob with a stainless steel extractor and glass splashback. A stainless steel inset sink sits below the side window, bringing in natural light, while a charming circular porthole window offers a playful view to the garden. Whether you’re brewing morning coffee, serving Sunday brunch, or mixing evening cocktails, this kitchen is the kind of space that brings people together. Bedrooms for Dreaming Thoughtfully arranged to offer comfort, privacy, and flexibility, the four double bedrooms in this home provide inviting sanctuaries for family members and guests alike. Ground Floor Bedrooms On the ground floor, Bedroom Two and Bedroom Three are both spacious doubles, each benefitting from their own private en-suite — an ideal setup for visiting guests, older children, or multi-generational living. Bedroom Two features fitted wardrobes, a dressing table, and matching bedside drawers, complemented by a stylish en-suite with a white vanity unit, WC, and a sleek shower enclosure with a folding glazed screen. Bedroom Three, currently arranged as a twin room, echoes the same greyed-oak herringbone flooring found in the open-plan living area. Its en-suite is finished in contemporary style with grey-tiled walls, a white vanity basin, WC, and a double shower enclosure with a glazed screen. Also on this level, the family bathroom is well-appointed with a p-shaped bath and overhead shower, curved glass screen, WC, and a white vanity unit with under-sink storage. Tiled white walls with a feature mosaic stripe contrast beautifully with dark floor tiling, creating a smart and practical finish. Light-Filled Transition Back in the central hallway — where the warm herringbone flooring continues — a Velux window draws in natural light above the staircase, which leads up to a striking galleried landing. Upstairs Bedrooms Upstairs, the main bedroom suite — a light, tranquil retreat with treetop views and built-in storage. Its en-suite is thoughtfully finished with a large double shower enclosure, glazed screen, white vanity basin, WC, and contemporary grey tiling, offering the perfect spot to unwind in peace and privacy. On the opposite side of the landing, Bedroom Four is currently used as a home office and features built-in shaker-style wardrobes and drawers in a crisp white finish, along with timber-effect laminate flooring — equally suited as a bedroom, nursery, or creative workspace. Stylish Bathrooms Throughout With four bathrooms in total — three of them en-suite — the home caters beautifully to modern family life. Each bathroom is finished to a high standard, with clean lines, sleek fittings, and a cohesive design palette that blends practicality with understated luxury. Garden Escape Tucked away at the rear, the garden offers a peaceful haven — private, beautifully landscaped, and thoughtfully designed for both relaxation and entertaining. A series of tiered paved patio terraces sweep gracefully from the back of the house around to the side, creating a natural extension of the open-plan kitchen and living area, ideal for al fresco dining or simply enjoying the sun. Raised flower beds frame the lower levels with seasonal colour and structure, while a set of paved steps leads to a generous upper terrace and an expansive lawned area bordered by mature trees and planting, offering privacy and lush green views. At the far end, a glass and aluminium greenhouse stands ready for the keen gardener. Whether it’s sipping morning coffee beside the charming old-fashioned water pump, enjoying a quiet afternoon in the sun, or gathering friends for summer evenings under the stars, this garden is designed to delight — a true extension of the home’s living space. Perfectly Positioned Tucked within one of Bromley Cross's most desirable enclaves, this home benefits from excellent schools, transport links to Bolton and Manchester, local cafés and restaurants and access to Jumbles country park, all within easy walking distance, combined with a community charm. In Summary This is not just a house — it's a lifestyle. A rare blend of modern architecture, flexible living, and tranquil outdoor space in a location that offers both peace and connectivity. Welcome to your forever home on Hillside Avenue.
