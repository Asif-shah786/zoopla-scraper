    "about_property": "Set on one of Holcombe Brook’s most established and highly sought-after roads, this extended five-bedroom period semi pairs timeless character with subtle contemporary style. Just a short stroll from a range of village amenities and glorious countryside walks, it’s a home that offers the very best of both worlds — heritage charm and modern practicality.\nSpanning three floors, the generous accommodation includes a spacious entrance hallway, large open-plan kitchen and dining room flowing onto the garden, two further substantial reception rooms, utility, downstairs WC, five bedrooms, two bathrooms and a storeroom. Outside, a private driveway, secluded sunny rear garden, and a versatile detached garden room complete the package.\nPeriod Character &amp; Charm\nFrom the moment you step through the original oak front door, the home’s heritage is evident. The hallway retains beautiful oak panelling and staircase, enhanced by statement tiled flooring. Period features continue throughout, from picture rails to open fires with cast iron surrounds, all set against a premium Farrow &amp; Ball colour palette. The current owners have done a superb job of preserving this charm while subtly upgrading the property to meet modern living standards.\nOpen-Plan Living\nThe showpiece of this home is the stunning open-plan kitchen and dining space created by the recent extension. A soaring vaulted ceiling, skylights, and French doors fill the room with natural light and create a seamless connection to the garden — ideal for relaxed summer living and entertaining.\nThe walnut breakfast bar invites Sunday brunches, while the quartz worktops and minimalist cabinetry keep the look sleek and timeless. A suite of Neff integrated appliances includes a dishwasher, oven and combination oven, five-zone induction hob with extractor, plus full-height fridge and freezer. Whether it’s hosting friends for dinner or enjoying busy family life, this is a space that works beautifully day to day.\nReception Rooms\nTwo further reception rooms offer flexibility for family life. The rear room opens onto the patio, making a wonderful summer lounge, while the bay-fronted room to the front is perfect for cosy winter evenings by the fire. Both feature traditional chimney breasts and open fireplaces, keeping the home’s character alive.\nPractical Spaces\nThe utility room mirrors the kitchen’s modern styling, with extra worktops, storage, and plumbing for laundry appliances. An external door makes it ideal as a secondary entrance for muddy boots and dogs.\nBedrooms &amp; Bathrooms\nAcross the first and second floors are five well-proportioned bedrooms, four of which are generous doubles. The fifth, currently used as a home office, enjoys far-reaching views towards Manchester.\nOn the first floor, the front bedroom boasts a charming mullion window, while the rear enjoys a bay with green garden views. The family bathroom is equally impressive, with a freestanding bath, walk-in shower, basin, and WC set against coordinating wall and floor tiles.\nThe second floor is perfect for a teenager or guest suite, with a spacious double bedroom under sloped ceilings and skylights, plus an adjacent shower room with a modern three-piece suite.\nOutside Space\nTo the front, a large driveway with EV charging point is framed by mature planting, giving excellent kerb appeal. The south-westerly rear garden is a true suntrap from midday to evening, with two patios — one for al-fresco dining, the other for lounging — plus a central lawn, mature borders, and fruit and vegetable planters for green-fingered buyers.\nThe detached garden studio, complete with power, lighting, and hot/cold water, is an adaptable space for a home office, gym, bar, or hobby room.\nLocation\nHolcombe Brook is one of Ramsbottom’s most desirable areas, offering a warm village feel with the convenience of excellent local amenities. Within walking distance you’ll find independent shops, cafés, cocktail bars, country pubs and restaurants, along with everyday essentials such as supermarkets and healthcare facilities. Highly regarded primary and secondary schools are nearby too, making this a popular choice for families.\nFor leisure, you’re spoilt with doorstep access to parks and scenic countryside trails across Holcombe Moor and the West Pennine Moors, perfect for walking, running, and cycling.

    "about_property": "Tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac in the sought-after village of Egerton, this deceptively spacious three-storey semi offers far more living space than your average semi-detached home. Recently upgraded with a brand-new kitchen and new roof in 2024, it combines modern comfort with stunning panoramic views over open countryside. Perfectly suited for family life, the layout includes a welcoming entrance hall, full-depth living room, spacious open-plan kitchen/dining room, home office, conservatory/utility, three bedrooms, and a family bathroom. Outside, the garage and under-garage basement provide exceptional storage, while the south-westerly garden captures the sun all afternoon through to spectacular sunsets.\nLiving Space\nStep inside to a generous entrance hall with plenty of space for coats, shoes, and everyday essentials, keeping the rest of the home clutter-free.\nOn the upper ground floor, the full-length living room offers a rare sense of scale, with large windows at both ends filling the room with natural light. From the rear, the window perfectly frames those breathtaking countryside views. The space is styled with a contemporary finish, complemented by a traditional chimney breast, oak mantel, and decorative inlet for added charm.\nAlso on this level, a dedicated home office/study provides a quiet corner to work or focus, away from the busier heart of the home.\nOn the lower ground floor, the impressive open-plan kitchen and dining room is the social hub, complete with underfloor heating for year-round comfort. The kitchen’s timeless yet modern design features integrated appliances, including a double oven, microwave, fridge-freezer, dishwasher, and a four-ring hob with concealed extractor. The breakfast bar seats four, while the spacious dining area is perfect for family meals and entertaining guests. The room flows into the conservatory/utility, leading directly out to the garden for easy indoor-outdoor living.\nBedrooms &amp; Bathroom\nUpstairs, three well-proportioned bedrooms make the most of the home’s elevated position, with the rear bedrooms enjoying those same incredible scenic views. The family bathroom offers a blank canvas for a modern update to your own taste and style.\nOutside Space\nTo the front, a private drive and garage provide easy parking, with the garage basement adding valuable extra storage.\nThe rear garden is a great highlight, south-westerly facing to catch the sun from midday until evening, with a raised decking area for relaxing, dining, and entertaining against the backdrop of breathtaking sunsets over Winter Hill. Below, the lawn offers space for children to play or for green-fingered owners to create their ideal garden retreat.\nLocation\nDespite the peaceful, elevated setting, you’re just moments from the heart of Egerton village and only a short drive to Bromley Cross. Both offer an excellent choice of pubs, restaurants, shops, and highly regarded schools and nurseries.\nFor outdoor lovers, the surrounding countryside, reservoirs, and West Pennine Moors provide endless opportunities for walking, cycling, running, and sailing.\nCommuters benefit from quick access to the A666 for motorway connections, while Bromley Cross Train Station — around five minutes’ drive — offers direct services into central Manchester.\nKey Details\nTax band: C\nTenure: Leasehold\nGround rent: £14 per annum\nLease term: 1000 years from 1969\nHeating: Gas boiler and radiators\nBoiler: Worcester combi, installed in 2024\nLoft: Insulated and boarded with a pull-down ladder installed\nRead\n full description\nIn partnership with\nZoopla insights\nSign in and gain expert analysis to make informed decisions.\nStamp duty calculator\nOur instant calculator helps you understand how much stamp duty is due on property purchases in England &amp; Northern Ireland.\n\nRead the latest stamp duty news\nPrice\nYour situation\nPlease select\nBuying for the first time\nHome mover with one property\nBuying an additional property\nFrom 1st April 2025\n\n£-\nThis calculation is intended as a guide only.

    "about_property": "The Pump House is an impressive fusion of contemporary architecture, luxury family living, and peaceful sanctuary — all wrapped in over 7,000 sq ft of exceptional space and nestled within 4.5 acres of private grounds. Elevated above a tranquil wooded valley with landscaped gardens cascading down to the river below, this magnificent home offers unrivalled privacy, awe-inspiring design, and a standard of living that must be seen to be fully appreciated.\nFrom the tree-lined driveway and bold architectural form to the exquisite interiors, bedroom suites, designer kitchen, multiple reception rooms, home cinema, indoor swimming pool and home gym — this is family life at its most refined. Located just moments from the amenities of Standish village, acclaimed schools, and key transport links, The Pump House is a home that delivers the very best of both worlds.\nAn Impressive Approach\nThe house is so discreetly positioned that if nobody told you it was here, you’d never know it existed. Accessed via electric gates, a tree-lined driveway opens to landscaped grounds and reveals the home in all its grandeur — perfectly framed by lush greenery and manicured lawns.\nThe main parking area is large enough for a whole fleet of cars, and the home welcomes you inside through a supersize bespoke solid oak door with glass surrounds, giving you the first impression of the grand proportions found throughout. A handy porch leads through to the central reception hall where you immediately notice the stylish oak and glass staircase, plus the abundance of natural light pouring in through the huge skylight window and glass wall at the rear.\nThe Designer Kitchen\nThe heart of the home is the exceptional designer kitchen and daily dining area — a breathtaking space with plentiful glass and panoramic views of the gardens and valley below. Bifold doors and three sets of French doors open onto a vast elevated composite deck, creating seamless indoor-outdoor living.\nDesigned and installed by the renowned Stuart Frazer, this premium Siematic kitchen features minimalist cabinetry, ambient recessed lighting, and deep Corian worktops. Every detail has been considered — from the walk-in pantry to the well-tailored storage and integral larder cabinets.\nA selection of Miele appliances includes two conventional ovens with warming drawers, a microwave, steam oven, full-length fridge and dishwasher. Additional highlights include a Bora induction hob with built-in downdraft extractor, a Quooker tap with instant boiling, chilled and sparkling water, a Liebherr full-length freezer, and twin Monogram wine fridges.\nAt the centre is an enormous island with a contrasting dark oak breakfast bar — a stunning and practical hub for everyday family life, relaxed weekends, or entertaining. Whether it's Sunday brunch, evening drinks with friends, or summer barbecues spilling out onto the decking, this space is made to be enjoyed.\nReception Rooms\nThe Pump House offers four distinct reception rooms, each delivering space, comfort, and flexibility for the modern family.\nThe main lounge is a showstopper — around 33 sq m in size, with a vaulted double-height ceiling, six-panel bifold doors, and a stylish glass inset log burner within a towering chimney breast and gallery landing above. It’s a room made for hosting on a grand scale or unwinding in total comfort.\nNext door, the media room offers another luxurious lounge experience, with floor-to-ceiling windows by day and a full cinema set-up by night — blackout blinds, projector screen, and surround sound at the touch of a button. It’s ideal as a cinema, games room or teenage retreat.\nOn the opposite side of the reception hall, the formal dining room enjoys an abundance of natural light, with French doors opening onto a covered al-fresco dining terrace. Perfect for dinner parties and special occasions, it blends elegance with atmosphere.\nAdjoining the kitchen is a peaceful day lounge — currently a relaxed sitting room with more French doors onto the garden. It’s the perfect spot for morning coffee, a children's playroom, or a snug for reading and relaxation.\nPractical Aspects\nFunctionality is fully considered, with a separate plant room, utility, guest WC, ample cloak storage, and a large, fully equipped home office designed for two people. A unique bonus is the first-floor laundry room — located near the bedrooms and complete with plumbing, sink, and generous storage.\nBedrooms &amp; Bathrooms\nThe entire first floor benefits from vaulted ceilings and striking architectural lines. Full-height apex windows and walls of glass frame tranquil green views from every room.\nEach of the five double bedrooms has its own sleek three-piece en-suite with tiled surrounds and modern fittings, all immaculately maintained. The master suite adds a walk-in dressing room and a stunning private balcony beneath an apex roof — your own peaceful morning sanctuary just steps from the bed.\nLeisure Facilities\nThe indoor swimming pool is a standout feature, newly refurbished and upgraded with a Calorex system in 2025. Enjoy year-round heated swimming with a swim-jet system for endless laps, plus a hot tub, skylights, floor-to-ceiling windows, and bifold doors connecting you back to the neighbouring nature.\nAccessed via a covered walkway from the house and also from the first floor via a spiral staircase, it’s a true private spa experience. A home gym links the gallery landing to the pool hall — equally suited to yoga or conversion into a wellness suite or sauna.\nA Luxury Finish\nFrom the moment you enter, the luxury is unmistakable — bespoke oak joinery and flooring, natural stone tiling, gallery landings, vast proportions, and world-class appliances throughout.\nA Control4 smart home system allows you to manage lighting, heating, and audio from your phone, delivering comfort and convenience with every touch.\nGardens, Grounds &amp; Garages\nSet on approximately 4.5 acres with no neighbours in sight, this is more than a home — it's a countryside retreat. The gated driveway delivers complete seclusion and leads to a shale-surfaced parking area, triple garage, and carport with EV charging point.\nTo the rear, a full-width composite deck with glass balustrades offers a breath-taking entertaining space overlooking the valley and river. It’s piled into the ground for structural integrity and generously sized to accommodate sun loungers, dining zones, or even an outdoor kitchen if desired.\nThe surrounding grounds include manicured lawns, landscaped borders, rockeries, and mature trees. To one side, Japanese-inspired tiered lawns step down to a large wildlife pond, offering a magical connection to the river and nature. A children’s treehouse completes the picture — making this a truly special home for every generation.\nLocation\nDespite its extraordinary privacy, The Pump House is just moments from the bustling and sought-after village of Standish — home to a wide selection of independent shops, cafes, restaurants, gyms, supermarkets, and top-rated schools.\nThe M6 motorway is a short drive away, placing Manchester, Preston, and the wider North West within easy commuting distance. This rare combination of peace, privacy, and connectivity makes the location just as impressive as the home itself.\nSpecific Details\nCouncil Tax Band: H\nTenure: Freehold\nHeating: Gas boiler and tank with water-based underfloor heating throughout\nDrainage: Private septic tank\nUtilities: Mains gas, electricity, and water\nSecurity: Full alarm system with CCTV\nSmart Home: Control4 automation system\nRead\n full description\nIn partnership with\nZoopla insights\nSign in and gain expert analysis to make informed decisions.\nStamp duty calculator\nOur instant calculator helps you understand how much stamp duty is due on property purchases in England &amp; Northern Ireland.\n\nRead the latest stamp duty news\nPrice\nYour situation\nPlease select\nBuying for the first time\nHome mover with one property\nBuying an additional property\nFrom 1st April 2025\n\n£-\nThis calculation is intended as a guide only.

The ground floor comprises generously sized rooms: A large open plan living dining kitchen, formal living room, dining room, executive study and utility boot room.

The vendors have cleverly retained and exposed some of the original brickwork in the hallway as a feature and all rooms have their own access to the terrace and gardens beyond.\nTo the first floor, the principal suite is generously sized, offering stylish fitted wardrobes housed in a separate dressing area, and a sizeable en-suite with freestanding tub, shower and marble topped sink unit. The bedroom has the benefit of a lovely sit on balcony overlooking the gardens below.

Beautifully stocked borders and hedging to the perimeters, ensure a high degree of privacy.\nLocation\nNestled in a prestigious conservation area, this residence enjoys a private setting yet remains conveniently close to local amenities being easily walkable to the nearest villages.\nThe property is superbly placed for access to the many amenities of fashionable Hale village and the town of Altrincham with their impressive range of restaurants, bistros and bars, specialist shops, cinema, artisan markets and supermarkets.

Framed by open countryside, its glass-roofed conservatory captures sweeping views across rolling fields, while the gardens – a blend of manicured lawns, vibrant borders, and stone pathways – offer peaceful corners to pause and take in the surroundings.\nThe approach sets the scene. A gentle climb along a farm track, edged with open green fields and drystone walls, draws you deeper into rural life. Passing through the working farmyard, the air carries the scent of hay and the occasional sound of livestock, a reminder of the home’s agricultural setting. Beyond the old stone gateposts and cattle grid, the paved driveway and integral double garage mark your arrival at this welcoming home.\nWhere Character Meets Comfort\nStep inside the covered portico entrance into a bright, contemporary hallway, complete with a handy cloakroom cupboard and direct access to the garage. The warmth of the timber front door, the herringbone flooring, and the overall light and airy feel immediately set the tone – this is a home that respects its heritage while embracing a stylish, modern finish.\nA Lounge for All Seasons\nTo the left lies the award-winning, magazine-featured lounge – a showpiece of style and comfort. A rustic double-sided stone fireplace with wood-burning stove anchors one wall, adding warmth and character. Soft recessed lighting casts a gentle glow over white walls, oak doors, and the stone-flagged floor that flows throughout the ground floor. Generous picture windows frame the surrounding greenery, creating a connection with the outdoors, while the spacious layout offers the flexibility for cosy evenings or larger gatherings. Integrated ceiling speakers in both the lounge and the kitchen enhance everyday living and entertaining, offering seamless, high-quality audio throughout the social heart of the home\nDining with a Sense of Occasion\nThe dining room is full of character, with flagstone flooring under centuries-old oak beams. The double-sided fireplace forms a striking focal point, perfect for lingering over candlelit dinners. A wide picture window overlooks the garden, bringing the changing seasons into every mealtime. Above, the double-height section reveals the oak staircase, complete with cleverly integrated storage beneath, linking the two floors with light and openness.\nThe Heart of the Home – Kitchen &amp; Conservatory\nThe kitchen/breakfast room is designed to be both functional and inviting. Soft grey cabinetry with brushed brass handles pairs with warm wood worktops, while a range-style cooker sits beneath a concealed extractor, framed by rustic herringbone tiling. Integrated appliances include an oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, dishwasher, wine cooler, and a farmhouse-style sink perfectly placed beneath a window to take in the countryside views.\nA breakfast bar seating four creates the ideal spot for casual dining, morning coffee, or catching up with friends. From here, a door opens to the conservatory – a light-filled space with glass walls and a vaulted roof that blurs the boundary between indoors and out. In summer, it’s bathed in sunshine with garden scents drifting in; in winter, the underfloor heating beneath the tiled floor keeps it warm and inviting, making it a peaceful place to watch frost settle over the fields. French doors lead directly onto the terrace.\nA useful downstairs WC is located off the kitchen lobby.\nThe garage, also accommodates the washing machine and serves as a practical laundry area, keeping day-to-day chores neatly out of sight.\nUpstairs – Four Bedrooms and Countryside Calm\nThe oak staircase leads to a vaulted landing filled with light from Velux windows, creating an airy welcome to the upper floor.\nBedroom One –\n The main bedroom enjoys far-reaching views from four windows, fitted wardrobes, and a feature oak-slat wall detail. The en-suite includes a double shower with glazed screen, vanity sink with mirror, WC, and marble-effect tiling to walls and floor.\nBedroom Two –\n A spacious double with a front-facing outlook, blue panelled feature wall, and built-in wardrobes.\nBedroom Three –\n Overlooking the side garden, decorated in soft pink to half height with a charming exposed beam behind the bed.\nBedroom Four –\n Currently a nursery, with a sage-painted feature wall and a view over the front.\nA Bathroom Designed for Comfort and Style\nThe family bathroom combines practicality with a sense of luxury. Large marble-effect tiles flow from floor to ceiling, reflecting light beautifully. A wall-hung toilet, contemporary vanity with warm wood countertop, and countertop basin with chrome mixer tap set the scene. An illuminated circular mirror adds soft ambience, complemented by recessed shelving. The bath, with rainfall shower over, invites both quick refreshes and long, indulgent soaks. A chrome heated towel rail and thoughtful design touches complete the space.\nGardens and Outlook\nThe gardens are a perfect marriage of open space, mature planting, and uninterrupted views. Lawns sweep around the property, bordered by established shrubs, seasonal flowers, and well-tended beds. A paved terrace alongside the conservatory offers a sunny spot for morning coffee or evening drinks, while stone pathways link different seating areas.\nA raised planting bed adds colour and structure, and a firepit area provides a cosy place to gather. Climbing plants soften timber and stone boundaries, while hedges offer privacy without interrupting the expansive views. From every vantage point, the rolling hills stretch into the distance – vibrant in summer, golden in autumn, and softly frosted in winter.\nIn the Village\nEdgworth offers a thriving community with everyday essentials and a welcoming atmosphere. Within walking distance, you’ll find a post office, village shop, butcher, two cafes, a hairdresser, and a beautician. The village also boasts a cricket club, 4G football pitches, and the much-loved Holden’s &amp; Co ice cream shop.\nFor dining, try the new gastropub at The Spread Eagle or the traditional charm of The White Horse and The Black Bull. Nearby Ramsbottom offers an even wider choice of restaurants and bars, just 10 minutes away.\nEdgworth Primary School is rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted, with secondary options at Turton School and Canon Slade, both also rated ‘Good’. Buses also run to Bury Grammar and Bolton independent schools.\nFor outdoor pursuits, the scenic Wayoh and Entwistle reservoirs are close by, along with the village park. Commuters benefit from excellent road links, with the M65 just 15 minutes away, and Bolton or Bury reachable in around 20 minutes.\nImportant Notice for Buyers\nWe do our best to make sure our property details are accurate and reliable, but they do not form part of any offer or contract and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.

The seller may charge additional fees payable upon completion. If applicable, such fees are detailed within the Special Conditions of Sale. Buyers are deemed to bid in full knowledge of this.\nThe Guide Price quoted must not be relied upon by prospective purchasers as a valuation or assessment of value of the property. It is intended to provide purchasers with an indication of the region at which the reserve may be set at the time of going to press. The guide price may be subject to variation and interested parties are advised to make regular checks for variations and should be aware that the reserve price may be either below or above the quoted guide price.\nProspective purchasers should also be aware that the eventual sale price may be above or below the guide level dependent upon competition, and should therefore not presume the guide to be indicative of the final expected sale price or the price the property is available at.\nWhen setting the guide price, the auctioneers have given consideration to the seller’s instructions in respect of their indicated reserve price at the time of instruction. The reserve price, (the level below which the property will not be sold), remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer. The guide price therefore, is intended to indicate the region at which the reserve price is intended to be set. The seller will confirm their final reserve price close to the auction date and if appropriate the auctioneers may adjust the guide price to reflect this.\nWhilst Barnard Marcus make every effort to ensure the safety and security of viewers at properties, we have not carried out a detailed Health &amp; Safety inspection of properties in our auctions and cannot therefore guarantee the safety and security of viewers.\nProspective purchasers and bidders attend properties entirely at their own risk.

The accommodation offers good sized and well-proportioned space over 2 floors. On the ground floor are three reception rooms, a kitchen, shower room, and boiler/utility room. Upstairs there are four bedrooms and a bathroom.\nThe Barns\n• A Planning Application has been approved under Section 19 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 to amend the approved proposals for the conversion of a traditional agricultural building into three residential dwellings (Ref: 106995/lbc/22).\n• The original scheme, which was granted with Listed Building Consent, includes the sensitive restoration and conversion of the building into three characterful homes (Use Class C3), along with associated external works, private amenity space, and parking provision. The project also involves the removal of more modern structures on the site, including a steel-framed agricultural building, a shed, and a car port, relocating two of the approved parking spaces to better integrate with the site layout and heritage context, enhancing the landscaping scheme, with additional planting to further soften the development and support local biodiversity\nLot 2 - The Farm Buildings\n• Complementing the traditional features of the property is a range of modern agricultural buildings positioned alongside a slurry lagoon and well-constructed silage clamps. These facilities are currently in use by a farming tenant under a Farm Business Tenancy, which is set to conclude in September 2025. These are available by separate negotiation.\nSituation\nBow Green Farm is situated in Bowdon, a leafy suburb of Altrincham within the borough of Trafford. While in a rural setting, it is within a 5-7 minute drive of Hale Village and Altrincham town centre, both of which offer a good range of independent shops, bars and restaurants, as well as several supermarkets.\nBowdon’s close proximity to the M56 motorway makes it an ideal location for commuting to Manchester, while the tram connection into Manchester is only 10 minutes away, offering a less stressful route to the city centre.\nBowdon village is host to many sporting/leisure activities including cricket, tennis and squash, all based at the nearby sports club. Dunham Golf Club is within a five-minute drive. For those looking for a more leisurely stroll, Dunham Massey estate, with its impressive gardens and deer park, is just 10 minutes away.\nOn the educational front, there are three primary schools in Bowdon, and the highly rated Altrincham Grammar",

And it has to be accessible! Stonelea on Bass Lane in Summerseat ticks all of those boxes and is indeed a bespoke country home and a rare opportunity. Built during the early 19th century Stonelea is a stone constructed, freehold semi detached country home having been meticulously restored and extended over the last 20 years to provide a beautiful family home.

The property is available for the first time in over 30 years, and with no onward chain, it’s perfect for those looking to make a quick and smooth transition.\nPark up by the garage or in front of the home and make your way to the front porch, where you’re welcomed by the characterful stone façade.\nWelcome Home\nStep inside, and the charm continues with a sitting room that features a beamed ceiling, mullioned windows, and original-style timber doors with traditional latches. This cosy space, perfect as a sitting room or even a study, immediately sets the tone for the rest of the home.\nFrom here, move through to the living room, which mirrors the same rustic décor with exposed beams. The focal point is an original stone fireplace with a black grate, around which the furniture is thoughtfully arranged. A window looks out onto the front garden, and there is an additional door providing another access point to the front. A staircase leads up to the first floor, adding to the natural flow of the ground floor layout.\nNext, flow into the kitchen, which is fitted with timber wall and base units, a contrasting worktop, and an integrated oven with a 4-ring gas hob.

Notably, a new combi boiler was installed in April 2024, providing peace of mind for years to come.\nStep Outside\nStep out into the front garden, which features a neatly maintained lawn, a paved patio, and cobbled areas perfect for low-maintenance outdoor relaxation.

These include single storey side and rear extensions aimed at providing proportionate additions to significantly enhance the overall floorspace of the dwelling.\nThe site of Dryfield Cottage is located within the designated Green Belt, where development is very much restricted. As a consequence, the use of ‘permitted development’ (pd) does offer the potential for extensions and the like that otherwise may not be granted planning permission. These provisions (pd) have been influential with regard the plans which have been prepared.\nConsequently, the extensions are aimed at benefitting from ‘permitted development’ i.e. Elements of these proposals are unlikely to require planning permission. If the development was proposed, as suggested, or variations of such a development, then further discussion would be required as regards the position in respect planning legislation. It would be recommended that a ‘Certificate of Lawfulness’ or ‘Prior Approval’ from Chorley Council should be persued. Further advice can be given in this respect.\nThe extensions, as proposed, are architect designed and seek to sympathetically extend the initial cottage in a contemporary way. The design has specific regard to the relative scale which would result between the existing and proposed, roof profiles, the proportion of the window openings and use of facing materials. The outbuilding proposes ancillary residential provision, including an ensuite bedroom, day/hobbies room and small gym. Alternative residential uses, which would be incidental to the main use of the site for the existing dwelling may well be acceptable. The site plan also includes off street parking.\nThe proposals seek to take full advantage of the site and existing dwelling including maximising views across the site and to the wider landscape, sunlight, and daylight into rooms and maintaining privacy.\nFurther information is available regarding the potential for development on the site can be provided.\nAgents description\nA fantastic and rare opportunity to purchase a detached home which is situated within a generous plot of around 0.224 of an acre and located in a very high calibre semi rural location with open fields to the side and rear plus a superb view of Rivington Pike and the surrounding hills.\nThe property would no doubt suit those downsizing from a large home but wishing to retain large gardens and a high quality location. There is also great potential to work with the existing structure and gain planning permission to extend and thus create a house tailored to a buyers own style and specification. Equally, a buyer my consider wholesale redevelopment of the plot where the location can support selling figures in excess of £1M.\nThe current layout includes a lounge and breakfast kitchen to the ground floor and two bedrooms plus bathroom and separate shower room to the first floor. Either the shower room or bathroom could easily be sacrificed to create an additional bedroom.\nWe are advised that the property is Freehold and council tax band E\nThe Area:\nDryfield Lane is a highly regarded road in Rivington which is a village just on the outskirts of Horwich. The location blends a rural setting seamlessly with excellent access to facilities and an excellent transport links. The popular and independent Bolton School is around 5 miles away and Dryfield Lane is close to their bus route. Horwich town centre, which includes a good collection of largely independently owned shops and services is under one mile away whilst larger retail outlets can be found towards the Middlebrook development close to the football stadium which includes associated transport links (Horwich Parkway train station on the mainline to Manchester plus junction 6 of the M61).\nBlackrod train station is physically the closest rail link, is on the main line to Manchester and is around 1.5 miles away whilst the motorway junction is around 3 miles aware. Those busy working in Manchester city centre, for example, would no doubt relish their journey home to a rural retreat to enjoy the country park setting and enviable views.

Being the only detached unit adds an additional level of prestige and the commanding plot adjoins open fields.\nThe home was only constructed around 10 to 15 years ago, and therefore combines the rural setting and farm characteristics of stone walls under a slated roof with the benefits of modern construction methods and insulation qualities.\nThe room proportions speak for themselves and there has been a great provision for storage within both the double garage and additional outbuilding. A large driveway caters for a mass of vehicles and also allows for the private storage of motorhomes/caravans etc….\nThe sellers inform us that the property is Leaseholrd for a term of 999 years from 17.04.2003.\nCouncil Tax Band G - £3,568.48\nThe loft space is for the full footprint and has a ladder\nThe Area:\nDwellings of this style are often seen as a 'forever home' type and are seldom placed into the open market and therefore this can be seen as a rare opportunity to acquire such a property. As our clients have mentioned, the location strikes a superb balance of rural surroundings, yet handy transport links and we feel this characteristic will become increasingly important as the inner city and inner town locations become more densely populated.\nJunction 5 of the M61 is approx 5 miles away and Lostock train station which is on the mainline to Manchester is approx. 3.5 miles away. The area in which the property is situated has recently been purchased by The Woodland Trust who are heavily investing with the restoration and ongoing care of the moors and woodland. We feel this will only enhance what has long been regarded as a high calibre rural retreat.\nMany people who live in the vicinity consider Manchester and the Trafford Centre an appropriate distance to work, shop and socialise.

This section of the property lends itself well to the creation of a huge master suite with the further bedrooms having access to the ground floor bathroom but also have proportions sufficient to take an ensuite if desired.\nA real factor can be found for the second floor which is a fully open space, spanning the entire footprint and includes stunning floorboards and exposed roof structure. This could be used in a number of different styles be its bedrooms, extended accommodation or an inspirational home office.\nHistorically speaking 54 Church Street was built between 1803 and 1809 by the workers at the ‘Wallsuches Bleach Works’, from the proceeds of a Terminating Building Society, hence the properties are known as Club Houses. Originally No.2 Chapel Street was a bakehouse. The cellar of No.54 was used for cotton handloom weaving and had external access up into Chapel Street. No.54 is the only three-storey house in the area: The attic would have been used as a warehouse for raw materials and finished goods. There once was an interconnecting door from the back bedroom into No.56 and all along the terrace.\nAt the end of the 19th century, No.54 was a pub, the Three Horseshoes. During the early 20th century, the Horwich Town Band practised in the attic; access to the attic was via a fixed ladder and trapdoor from the back bedroom and there was still a partitioned servants’ bedroom in the sw corner with gas lighting.\nPrevious owners converted the 2 houses from flats back into a single dwelling.\nSince 1988 the house has provided a ground-floor 'Granny Flat’ and accommodation above for a family of five.\nThe sellers inform us that the property is Freehold\nCouncil Tax Band D - £2,297.19\nAuctioneers Comments:\nThis property is for sale by the Modern Method of Auction, meaning the buyer and seller are to Complete within 56 days (the \"Reservation Period\"). Interested parties personal data will be shared with the Auctioneer (iamsold).\nIf considering buying with a mortgage, inspect and consider the property carefully with your lender before bidding.\nA Buyer Information Pack is provided. The winning bidder will pay £349.00 including VAT for this pack which you must view before bidding.\nThe buyer signs a Reservation Agreement and makes payment of a non-refundable Reservation Fee of 4.5% of the purchase price including VAT, subject to a minimum of £6,600.00 including VAT. This is paid to reserve the property to the buyer during the Reservation Period and is paid in addition to the purchase price. This is considered within calculations for Stamp Duty Land Tax.\nServices may be recommended by the Agent or Auctioneer in which they will receive payment from the service provider if the service is taken. Payment varies but will be no more than £450.00. These services are optional.\nThe Area:\nLocated opposite the Parish Church, Church Street is regarded as a high calibre part of the town. A key strength to homes within this area is their ability to provide access into the countryside which is possible to access just past the church. Footpaths lead into the hills that provide an impressive backdrop to the town.\nWhilst these rural links are so close to hand, the town also functions brilliantly as a commuter belt towards Manchester benefiting from access to several train stations linking to the city, together with junctions 5 and 6 of the M61. The commercial centre itself includes a pleasant range of mainly independently owned shops and services and within around half a mile of the subject property there is childcare at nursery level whilst the town has several primary and secondary schools.\nThe nearby Chorley Old Road is a bus route linking Bolton to Chorley and commercial amenities are enhanced by the Middlebrook retail development which is close to the previously mentioned junction 5 motorway link. The retail park is around 1.5 miles away and includes a wealth of large outlets together with restaurants, cinema, gym etc. All in all, we feel that the area offers a family-friendly package.\nCellar Rooms\nA number of cellar rooms essentially a mirror of un extended area of the ground floor and with good head height.

A host of integrated appliances include four Neff ovens (microwave, steam and two conventional), Neff dishwasher, Samsung American-style fridge-freezer and an induction hob within the central island breakfast bar, which also features an undermounted sink with Quooker instant boiling tap.\nCleverly designed to wrap around the kitchen, the dining and lounge areas of this sociable and open plan family kitchen flow off from the central island, which also features breakfast bar seating, retaining a connection between the chef and the rest of the household.\nFamily Time\nOverflowing with light and with incredible views out over the countryside, reservoirs and distant hills, big bifolding doors to three sides retain that constant connection to the outdoors.

Many years ago, the family purchased an additional strip of land and so there is a greater width when compared to some similar homes within the vicinity. Main services are connected, and our clients have also acquired the freehold.\nThe current dwelling is a four bedroom detached which in itself is a pleasant size but equally modest when compared to some of the more recently constructed properties along the road. As such, we are happy to report that our clients have gained detailed planning to construct a ‘super home’ of 10,000 ft.².\nAs such, the lengthy and costly legwork has been completed and establishes a remarkable concept. If a buyer wished to create a smaller dwelling, this should therefore be achievable subject to the usual consents.\nAs you will see, there are a number of CGI images to illustrate the proposed build and no doubt the buyer who presents will have a desire to create a high calibre bespoke home safe in the knowledge that the postcode supports high value transactions.\nThe sellers inform us that the property is Freehold\nCouncil Tax is Band G - £3,628.51\nSt Andrews Road is located just off Links Road and Chorley New Road. The high calibre address sits within the heart of Lostock and hosts large individual dwellings, many of which boasting a significant value. As such a buyer can be comfortable in the knowledge that the tone of value within the immediate area is at a high level.\nMany people would wish to settle in the area to benefit from the outstanding transport infrastructure which includes junction 6 of the M61 (around 2 miles away) and Lostock train station (around1 mile away) which is on the mainline to Manchester. Bolton School is also a consistent reason for residents to settle within the area and it is worth noting that a bus route runs along the nearby Chorley New Road and that the school is just around 2 miles away.\nIn terms of shops and services, Horwich town centre and the Middlebrook leisure and retail development include a great variety of outlets from small independent traders to large supermarkets, whilst many locals consider Manchester as an appropriate distance to shop, work and socialise. There is a choice of 2 golf clubs practically on the doorstep with a further variety of gyms and racquet clubs which serve the area. In summary Links Road has a great family friendly package on offer in what has long been regarded as one of the area’s leading residential zones and as such an early viewing should be considered essential.\nReception Room 1\n1 5.17m (17') x 5.15m (16'11\")\nBay window to front, two windows to side\nReception Room 2\n4.77m (15'8\") x 4.56m (15')\nBow window to front, two windows to side\nReception Room 3\n3.25m (10'8\") x 2.59m (8'6\")\nWindow to rear, door to stairs.\nMorning Room\nBay window to side\nKitchen\n4.15m (13'7\") x 2.44m (8')\nWindow to side\nPantry\n2.71m (8'11\") x 1.18m (3'10\")\nWindow to rear\nLaundry Room\n3.00m (9'10\") max x 2.21m (7'3\")\nWindow to rear\nBedroom 1\n5.71m (18'9\") x 4.56m (14'11\") plus 0.36m (1'2\") x 0.36m (1'2\")\nTwo windows to side, window to front\nEn-Suite 1\nWindow to front\nBedroom 2\n4.57m (15') x 4.15m (13'7\")\nBow window to front, two doors.\nBedroom 3\n4.56m (14'11\") x 3.77m (12'4\")\nTwo windows to side, window to rear\nBedroom 4\n4.25m (13'11\") x 3.22m (10'7\")\nWindow to rear, window to side\nBathroom\nWindow to side\nRead\n full description\nIn partnership with\nZoopla insights\nSign in and gain expert analysis to make informed decisions.\nStamp duty calculator\nOur instant calculator helps you understand how much stamp duty is due on property purchases in England &amp; Northern Ireland.\n\nRead the latest stamp duty news\nPrice\nYour situation\nPlease select\nBuying for the first time\nHome mover with one property\nBuying an additional property\nFrom 1st April 2025\n\n£-\nThis calculation is intended as a guide only.

Recently renovated and ready for you to move in, this spacious family home offers three double bedrooms, two reception rooms, and a large kitchen with a separate utility area. Every detail has been thoughtfully considered to preserve the period character while integrating contemporary essentials.\nThe front of the property is framed by hedgerows, creating a private and inviting atmosphere. A paved driveway offers convenient parking for one vehicle, leading you to the front door of this delightful home.\nElegant &amp; Spacious Living\nFrom the moment you enter, the warmth and charm of this home are immediately apparent. The porch features tropical Art Deco 'Grace Water Blue' wallpaper, setting the tone for the rest of the property.\nThe two reception rooms provide ample space for both relaxation and entertaining. High ceilings, period details, original doors and handles, and tasteful décor create a welcoming atmosphere. Large windows allow natural light to flood in, brightening the entire space. The dining room boasts deep picture rails, period putty-pink walls adorned with floral shabby chic wallcovering, a feature fireplace with a tiled hearth, and wide-plank timber laminate flooring. The living room showcases a wide bay window with views over the front garden, dark blue walls to picture rail height with white above, and a stone fireplace with a gas fire. The full wall behind the fire is decorated with Hestia mustard wisteria-style wallpaper.\nThe kitchen, located at the rear of the house, features grey painted cabinets, a white granite-effect worktop, a double stainless steel sink under the rear window with a view of the garden, plumbing for a dishwasher, and a white bird-patterned wallpaper. An original ornamental fire adds character, and walnut laminate flooring completes the space.

A separate utility room adds convenience and practicality.\nComfortable &amp; Stylish Bedrooms\nClimb the stairs, passing a half-landing window, and you’ll reach a spacious landing painted in putty pink with burnt sienna Nouveau-style wallpaper at the head of the staircase.\nUpstairs, three double bedrooms offer peaceful retreats, each designed to maximize space and light. The spacious front-facing master bedroom is decorated with bird wallpaper at picture rail height, bright green behind the bed, and plenty of room for a full set of furniture. The second bedroom, also to the front is painted in a vibrant orange with original floorboards. The third bedroom, overlooking the rear garden, features forest green to picture rail height and pink above, with treated original floorboards.\nThe recently refurbished bathroom exudes luxury, with a stunning roll-top bath and overhead shower, a glazed screen, a stylish wall-hung deep blue vanity unit, and a separate WC. The marble-effect wall tiling and Moroccan-style flooring tiles add to the elegant feel.\nA Garden to Enjoy\nThe outdoor space is just as impressive as the interior. The rear garden is well-maintained and low-maintenance, featuring a large paved patio and dedicated vegetable and fruit patches for those who enjoy growing their own produce. A split-level patio area provides the perfect setting for outdoor dining or relaxing in a peaceful atmosphere. The garden is enclosed with timber fencing, making it ideal for children and pets. There is also a large shed that houses a motorcycle/bikes with a ground anchor inside for added security.

Measurements, photographs, floor plans, and any services or appliances listed are for guidance only — they may not be exact or tested. Some photographs may include virtually staged furnishings and décor intended to illustrate potential layouts or styling.\nFixtures &amp; Fittings\nAny fixtures and fittings not specifically mentioned in the property details should be agreed separately with the seller.\nAnti-Money Laundering (aml) &amp; Buyer id Checks\nTo comply with legal requirements, we must verify the identity of all buyers before we can move forward with a sale. We’ll also need proof of funds and details of your instructed solicitor at this stage. At Newton &amp; Co, we use a trusted third-party provider to complete these checks securely and quickly. There’s a small, non-refundable fee of £25 per person (or £50 if you’re buying through a company), which is paid directly to us when you’re ready to proceed. Please note, we can’t issue a memorandum of sale until these checks are complete — so the sooner they’re done, the sooner we can help you secure your new home.\nRelationship Disclosure\nIn line with Section 21 of the Estate Agents Act 1979, we must declare if the owner of a property is related to anyone at Newton &amp; Co. If that’s ever the case, we’ll always let you know.\nReferral Fees\nWe may recommend trusted partners for extra services you might need — such as conveyancing, mortgage advice, insurance, or surveys. Sometimes we receive a small referral fee for introducing you to these providers. You’re under no obligation to use them and you’re always welcome to choose your own.\nRead\n full description\nIn partnership with\nZoopla insights\nSign in and gain expert analysis to make informed decisions.\nStamp duty calculator\nOur instant calculator helps you understand how much stamp duty is due on property purchases in England &amp; Northern Ireland.\n\nRead the latest stamp duty news\nPrice\nYour situation\nPlease select\nBuying for the first time\nHome mover with one property\nBuying an additional property\nFrom 1st April 2025\n\n£-\nThis calculation is intended as a guide only.

Whilst the property had been well cared for during the lengthy ownership, aesthetically and layout wise the home was dated and subsequently a significant program of modernisation has taken place with a reconfiguration and an extension having now been completed.\nThe result is a stunning home with modern curb appeal by way of double apex roofline, neutral rendering and anthracite windows. The driveway has been enlarged to accommodate family sized parking whilst the garage has been retained. There is scope for further conversion should additional ground floor space or bedroom be required. The two primary bedrooms with their vaulted ceilings should allow this home to stand out from the crowd.\nThis truly is one not to be missed and an early viewing is recommended.\nThe property is Freehold\nCouncil Tax is Band F - £3,318.18\nThe Area:\nMorris Fold Drive is located just off Regent Road which is located within the heart of Lostock and is seen by many as one of the more prestigious roads within the area. A particularly strong feature of the road is access to Lostock train station which is around 0.3 miles away and links to Manchester and its airport.\nLostock County Primary School is just a few minutes from the property and the train station itself and many people buy within this area seeking good access to the private schooling on offer within the town (Bolton School is just over 2 miles away). Whilst the train station is well placed, Junction 5 and 6 of the M61 are also easily accessible. The closest commercial centre is within the out-of-town retail complex close to the Toughsheet Community Stadium at the Middlebrook retail complex which includes a number of supermarkets and large outlets together with gym, bowling alley, cinema, restaurants etc. There are also two golf courses and a tennis club within easy walking distance.\nMany locals also consider Manchester and the Trafford Centre as an appropriate distance for both socialising and work. Whilst many of these features are ideal for living within a commuter belt of a large city, the town also boasts very popular countryside including a stretch of the West Pennine Moors and Winter Hill.\nHallway\n6' 6\" x 6' 7\" (1.98m x 2.01m) With access to wc, fitted store and the snug.\nSnug\n9' 10\" x 15' 3\" (3.00m x 4.65m)\nOpen Plan Living Space\n38' 1\" (max) x 25' 1\" (max) (11.61m x 7.65m) A huge space with plentiful glazing and designed to crate definitive zones but embracing the open plan concept.\nUtility\n5' 8\" x 4' 9\" (1.73m x 1.45m) A sleek design with side exit door and access into the garage.\nBedroom 1\n12' 6\" (max) x 14' 10\" (max) (3.81m x 4.52m) A stunning lead bedroom with vaulted ceiling and feature window to apex.

Ft.\nNo Chain\n5-Bed Detached Property With 2 Separate Annex Properties (Total 8 Bedrooms)\nSubstantial Family Home Set In A Picturesque Location\nEscape the hustle and bustle of modern life and rediscover the restorative charms of the countryside at Holme Fold Farm, in Farnworth.\nA home filled with rich history, that is of the land, Holme Fold Farm is a true character home, brimming with original features including centuries’ old, exposed beams.\nDating back to 1830, this former farmhouse has so much potential; with spacious rooms, a studio annex and two independent cottages, its flexibility is limitless – from family home with ample guest accommodation to hotel, farm, smallholding, lifestyle business; the versatility of the buildings and 2.7 acres of land cannot be underestimated.\nA warm welcome\nPull through the bespoke iron gates and along a lengthy driveway, where there is ample parking for at least six cars, before making your way to the porch entrance, where a multifuel stove provides a buffer of warmth as you step indoors away from the elements.\nTo the right, make your way into the sitting room, where an incredible carved wood and redbrick original fireplace houses a gas fire. Currently used as a study, this cosy room features handsome exposed beams to the ceiling, with quality, hardwearing carpet underfoot. On windy days, shut the door to the world and feel the solidity of the thick stone walls, retaining warmth in winter and keeping a cool interior in the summer months.\nWine and dine\nOpening up from the sitting room is the dining room, where a traditional look, real-flame gas fire adds rustic glow. Deep set windows frame views out over the courtyard whilst beams overhead – sourced from ancient ships – infuse this characterful room with olde worlde warmth.\nConveniently connected to the dining room, follow the easy flow of Holme Fold Farm through to the kitchen, where original flagstone flooring adds authentic farmhouse charm underfoot. Practical and robust, this flooring is perfectly in keeping with the country-style cabinetry that surrounds, providing plenty of storage.\nTraditional touches\nOverhead, in the white painted beams, original meat hooks can still be spied. With plenty of space for freestanding appliances beneath the solid oak worktops, there is ample potential to update this kitchen, with scope to open it up to the studio apartment beyond, creating a modern open-plan dining-kitchen. Views extend over the cobblestone courtyard, filled with colour and planted with flowers, trees and shrubs.\nIdeal for family living, room leads on from room at Holme Fold Farm, with the kitchen conveniently connecting to the front lounge.\nA superbly sized family room, modern spotlighting balances against the original beams inlaid within the ceiling above. Warmth fills the room from the stove, set within a handsome exposed redbrick surround, whilst views extend over the front garden.\nBedtime beckons\nCompleting the loop of the home, ascend the stairs from the sitting room to arrive on the upstairs landing, where recently fitted pale grey carpets harmonise with the white walls for a calming feel.\nOn the left, discover bedroom four, a good-sized double bedroom offering incredible views over the front of the home, with fields unfurling as far as the eye can see. A sunny, south-facing room, catch the sunrise and sunsets from this bedroom, and spy deer roaming the dew-covered meadows.\nFreshen up in the bathroom opposite, beautifully proportioned and furnished with a traditional clawfoot bathtub, shower, wash basin with traditional taps and WC. Resin flooring, impervious to water, is practical underfoot. Pale grey and white tones mingle with rustic black beams.\nComing out of here, turn right to arrive at bedroom three, another good size double framing views out over the courtyard.\nRoom for all\nOpposite, the largest bedroom awaits, bright and airy, and following the same soothing grey and white decorative motif as the preceding bedrooms. Furnished in traditional fashion, this bedroom is a true sanctuary.\nFurther along the landing, sneak a peek at the fitted storage, before arriving at bedroom two on the left, a room with ample storage and served by its own shower room ensuite.\nOverlooking the courtyard to the rear, also furnished with a soothing shower room ensuite, is a sixth bedroom. Dressed in white and grey, each bedroom and bathroom has its own fresh, contemporary feel.\nRental potential\nWith six bedrooms and so much space in the main home, consider the potential of the studio one-bedroom annex, one-bedroom cottage and two-bedroom cottage which also come with Holme Fold Farm; each furnished with bathroom, lounge and kitchen.\nIdeal as overspill accommodation for large families, for Airbnb rental or even as self-contained business units, the potential is vast.\nOutdoor living\nOutside, a coal shed and cycle shed provide plenty of storage (an old-fashioned door in the rear garden, once used for coal deliveries is a hint to the 1800s origins of the home).\nSix areas of garden provide different pockets of privacy in which to relax, unwind and appreciate the peaceful rural setting of Holme Fold Farm. Perfect for children’s games, a formally planted area accompanies a picnicking area with bench seating. Wildlife is in abundance, encouraged by mature trees and hedging, which also provide privacy and shelter.\nOwner quote: “You could have your own swimming pool, gym or llama farm; all the potential is there.”\nMake your way to the 2.72-acre field, a sufficient size for two horses, and survey the sublime surroundings. Observe the 320-degree open country views, taking in the distinct beauty of six counties, including snow-capped moorlands and sunny meadows. Watch the new year fireworks beneath a blanket and with a flask of mulled wine.\nAdditional outbuildings include a barn currently used for storage and a large shipping container, used as a lock up.\nOn your doorstep\nEnjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside at Holme Fold Farm, surrounded by fields and where at night you can sit out and hear the bats flitting about, replaced by the piercing cries of buzzards in the daytime.\nRurality and refuge come replete with convenience and connectivity, with five supermarkets close by, the nearest only eight minutes away.\nDip into the hustle and bustle of the world with a trip to the cinema, only 15 minutes’ drive from the door, whilst the Middlebrook Retail Park is just over ten minutes’ drive away.\nFamilies are well served by a plethora of local primary, state and secondary schools, whilst the independent Bolton School is also less than 15 minutes’ drive away.\nCommute with ease; the motorway junction is only five minutes from the door – though you’d never know it. The vast greenery of Great Lever and Farnworth Golf Club provides a buffer between Holme Fold Farm and the Royal Bolton Hospital – a mere five or so minutes’ drive away.\nOwner quote: “One minute you’re in a semi-rural world; the next you can be in suburbia surrounded by modern life.”\nFor those who love character properties and are looking for the flexibility to build their own life around them, Holme Fold Farm is a versatile oasis of calm, wherein you can escape the inflexibility of modern life. Not just a home, it’s a lifestyle; and it’s ready for its next adventure.\nAgent notes:\n Important Notice for Buyers\nWe do our best to make sure our property details are accurate and reliable, but they do not form part of any offer or contract and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.

A spacious driveway leads to an integrated garage, providing plenty of space for family living or weekend visitors.\nStep Inside – Where Style and Detail Meet\nCross the threshold into a hallway that makes an instant impression – stretching elegantly ahead and setting the tone for the rest of the home. Wood-effect tiled flooring runs underfoot, complementing the soft grey damask-style wallcovering that adds a touch of classic sophistication.

With and integrated Beko double fridge/ freezer, plumbing for a washing machine and tumble dryer, plus a door to the garden, this space blends functionality with style.\nWhether you're preparing a relaxed breakfast or hosting an evening with friends, this kitchen truly is the heart of the home.\nFlexible Living – The Perfect Multi-Use Space\nTo the front of the home, a third reception room adds valuable versatility. Currently used as a stylish salon, it’s ideal for anyone running a business from home. Alternatively, it could make a fantastic home office, playroom, or even a fifth bedroom. Laminate flooring and silvery grey wallcovering create a chic, professional feel, while white walls and a large front-facing window bathe the room in natural light.\nA Flexible Family Home\nUpstairs, four beautifully presented bedrooms offer comfort, privacy, and practicality for every member of the household.\nThe main bedroom is a spacious sanctuary, flooded with natural light from two large windows overlooking the front aspect. A full wall of built-in wardrobes provides excellent storage, while the luxurious en-suite is finished to a high standard. A slate-effect shower enclosure with smoked-glass screens takes centre stage, complemented by textured feature tiling. The bespoke vanity unit houses a countertop bowl sink with an illuminated mirror above, flanked by fitted storage cupboards and a WC. Open shelving with integrated spotlighting is neatly built into the pelmet and plinth, while striking black and white geometric floor tiles complete the sophisticated look.\nBedroom two, also to the front of the home, includes its own en-suite and comes with built-in wardrobes, overhead storage, and matching bedside cabinets. The en-suite features a WC, wall-hung vanity basin with gloss-finished shelving beneath, a glazed shower enclosure, built-in storage cupboard, and beige-cream tiling for a soft, calming finish.\nTo the rear, two further bedrooms overlook the garden, both bathed in natural light.

It features a WC, a tiled-in bath with shower above and glazed screen, a wall-hung vanity unit with glossy drawer storage beneath, and an illuminated mirror above. The beige textured tiling and chrome heated towel rail bring a spa-like finish to this calming space.\nThe loft is accessible via a wooden loft ladder and is partially boarded, providing useful storage space.\nGarden Escapes &amp; Alfresco Evenings\nThe south-facing rear garden is a beautifully curated space, designed with both practicality and pleasure in mind—a true masterclass in stylish, low-maintenance outdoor living. Every corner has been thoughtfully considered to create zones for relaxation, entertainment, and everyday enjoyment.\nA sleek porcelain tiled patio is framed by chunky oak sleepers, offering a grounded, natural contrast and a rustic edge to the modern aesthetic. A low-maintenance artificial lawn provides a lush, evergreen centrepiece—perfect for children to play or for simply lounging under the sun without the hassle of upkeep.\nStep further and you'll find a stunning composite decked terrace, complete with recessed lighting that twinkles underfoot as day turns to night. Built-in raised planters line the rear and side of the decking, bursting with seasonal colour and greenery that softens the clean lines and brings a sense of tranquillity to the space. This area is perfectly positioned for alfresco dining, drinks with friends, or simply unwinding with a good book.\nIn one corner, the garden takes on a playful, sociable twist with a bespoke timber garden room, proudly marked as the “Beer Garden.” Whether you’re hosting weekend BBQs, summer garden parties, or retreating with a nightcap beneath the stars, this is an outdoor haven that truly elevates everyday living.\nPrivate, secure, and effortlessly stylish—this garden isn’t just a backdrop, it’s a destination.\nOut &amp; About\nThe Beeches offers an incredibly convenient location.\nA short walk takes you to the Smithills Hall Estate, where you can enjoy picturesque forest trails and woodlands, all easily accessible without the need for a car.\nFor dining, indulge in Mediterranean cuisine at San Marino, or head to Lottie’s of Belmont, a delightful farm shop and café just 2.5 miles from your doorstep.
