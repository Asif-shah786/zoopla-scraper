Luxury 4-Bed, 3-Rec Detached Family Home Off Belmont Rd
A Modern Luxury Home in a Tranquil Setting
Nestled in a tranquil cul-de-sac off Belmont Road in Sharples, Bolton, this exquisite 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom, 3-reception room detached home is the epitome of modern luxury.
Meticulously renovated from top to bottom, no detail has been overlooked in this stunning transformation.
As you approach, the brand-new driveway and landscaped garden invite you in, with an impressive aluminium front door setting the tone for what lies beyond. Step inside to a breathtaking central stairway, crowned by a sparkling chandelier, where every inch of the home has been thoughtfully redesigned to showcase the finest finishes and cutting-edge technology.
A highlight of the home is the bespoke Venetian plasterwork, tailored by a specialist to complement each room, transforming the walls into a canvas of artistic expression. Every aspect of the property is brand new—from the meticulously crafted tiles to the bespoke kitchen and opulent bathrooms.
The home has been fully rewired to feature a state-of-the-art electrical system, seamlessly blending modern convenience with luxury. Most features can be controlled via smartphone, providing a contemporary, tech-savvy living experience. An efficient new boiler with a 12-year warranty ensures reliability, while underfloor heating spans the entire ground floor with individual zone controls for optimal comfort. This home truly embodies a perfect blend of artistry, innovation, and modern living.
Sophisticated Living Spaces
Step through the custom black door to your right and enter the elegantly designed lounge.
This space is the ultimate relaxation haven, featuring a built-in media wall with a luxurious bronzed polished plaster finish, complete with an inset electric fireplace, wall-mounted TV point, and recessed shelving on either side, all highlighted by spotlights above. The same striking marble flooring from the hallway continues seamlessly, creating a harmonious flow throughout the home.
A Designer Kitchen Beyond Compare
Spanning the rear of the home, the new kitchen exudes modern elegance, a space where sophistication meets functionality. Sunlight pours in through expansive sliding glass doors, illuminating the sleek, open-plan design and creating a seamless connection to the lush greenery outside.
At the heart of the room is a commanding island, draped in dark, veined marble that cascades in smooth waterfall edges. Around it, plush grey stools with gleaming gold bases invite conversation, blending comfort with opulence. Above, recessed LED lights sprinkle a soft, even glow, reflecting off glossy white floors that seem to stretch endlessly, amplifying the room's airy and luminous charm.
The cabinetry is a study in understated luxury. Its handleless design, swathed in dark marble with elegant gold accents, conceals integrated appliances including top-of-the-range Siemens appliances, including a coffee machine, two steam ovens, and a combi microwave. Every detail whispers refinement, from the clean, minimalist lines to the subtle interplay of textures. The kitchen’s polished surfaces and monochrome tones are balanced by the outdoors visible through floor-to-ceiling glass, inviting nature’s calm into the space. This is more than a kitchen—it’s a sanctuary of style, where culinary creativity and elegant living coexist effortlessly.
Striking Dual-Sided Fireplaces
Anchoring the kitchen and living spaces are dual linear electric fireplaces, each framed in a textured golden surround that exudes warmth and grandeur. Visible from both sides, these fireplaces create a stunning focal point, with their flickering flames reflecting the golden accents throughout the home. Above each fireplace, recessed alcoves provide ideal spaces for sleek televisions or statement art pieces, completing the sophisticated design.
New windows and doors, including sleek bifold doors leading to the private rear garden, enhance the seamless indoor-outdoor flow, perfect for both relaxation and entertaining. Phone-compatible spotlights throughout add an extra layer of modern convenience, allowing you to set the perfect lighting ambiance with just a tap. Every inch of this home has been meticulously crafted to offer a lifestyle of unparalleled elegance and contemporary comfort.
Versatile and Flexible Spaces
At the front of the ground floor, a third reception room presents a versatile space, perfectly suited as an additional sitting room, a playroom, or a private study for those working from home. Designed with flexibility in mind, this room adapts effortlessly to meet the needs of modern living.
All the bathrooms in the home, imported directly from Italy, are a true testament to luxury, showcasing the high-end Gessi brand. Thoughtfully designed for both style and practicality, each bathroom includes built-in storage and handy shelving, ensuring a seamless blend of elegance and functionality.
No expense spared even the downstairs guest wc is a vision of modern luxury. Polished white marble, veined with gold and grey, wraps the space in elegance, while a bold black vanity supports a copper basin that gleams like a jewel.
A circular backlit mirror casts a soft glow, its halo effect amplifying the drama. Slender copper pendants descend from a metallic-textured ceiling, echoing the basin’s warmth. The wall-mounted toilet, paired with a matte black flush plate, blends seamlessly into the minimalist design. Every detail, from hidden LED lighting to subtle accessories, whispers sophistication. A compact space transformed into a statement of artistry.
Luxurious Bedrooms and Bathrooms
Upstairs, soft silk carpet sweeps across the landing and into all four double bedrooms, wrapping the space in quiet luxury.
At the front, the main bedroom impresses with a sleek, integrated super-king LED bed—a perfect harmony of style and practicality. Neutral tones create a serene backdrop, while two windows, dressed with Venetian blinds, frame the view.
Step into the ensuite, where opulence awaits. Black and gold-veined marble tiles set the stage, highlighting a spacious double shower with LED-lit recesses. Contrasting white marble, a gold-accented vanity sink, and a WC complete this sophisticated retreat.
Bedroom two features a striking marble and copper-effect backdrop behind the bed, adding a touch of drama and elegance.
Its luxury ensuite continues the theme, boasting a grey marble-style counter topped with a sleek black bowl sink. A storage cupboard below offers practicality, while a double shower with LED-lit recesses and black fittings completes the space with a bold, modern edge.
Bedrooms three and four provide a neutral canvas, ready for your personal touch. Crisp white walls, soft grey carpeting, black skirtings, and wall-mounted radiators create a sleek, modern foundation.
One bedroom elevates the experience with a luxurious glass Juliet balcony, framing stunning views over Bolton—a perfect spot to soak in the scenery
The family bathroom is a haven of indulgence, featuring a freestanding bath paired with elegant copper floor-mounted taps. A provision for a tiled TV invites you to unwind in ultimate comfort.
Dual bowl sinks rest on a sleek black marble-style countertop, set against a polished wall backdrop and matching reflective ceiling. A spacious walk-in shower completes this luxurious retreat, blending style and relaxation seamlessly.
Indoor-Outdoor Living at Its Finest
Step outside and immerse yourself in a garden designed for enjoyment, day or night. In the summertime, open the expansive bifold doors to create a seamless flow between indoors and out, perfect for lively barbecues and relaxed entertaining.
The tiled patio stretches the full depth of the house, offering ample space for dining and lounging, while a sleek glazed balustrade adds a modern touch. Beyond, steps lead down to a lush, manicured lawn, providing a soft, open space for children to play and pets to roam freely. Fully enclosed for privacy and safety, this outdoor haven is as practical as it is inviting—a true extension of the home.
Prime Location for Modern Living
Tucked away off Belmont Road in the sought-after area of Sharples, this home enjoys the best of both worlds—situated on a peaceful residential estate while bordering the picturesque open countryside. It’s an ideal setting for those who cherish scenic walks and outdoor adventures right on their doorstep.
Families will appreciate the convenience of having High Lawns Primary School and Thornleigh Salesian College within easy walking distance. For leisure, local gems like The Wilton Arms pub and a variety of restaurants are close at hand, along with supermarkets and shops just minutes away by car.
Commuters will benefit from excellent transport links, with Bromley Cross and Hall i’th’ Wood train stations less than 1.5 miles away, offering seamless access to Manchester City Centre and beyond. This location truly combines tranquility with connectivity, making it a perfect place to call home.

A traditional garden fronted freehold property situated in a cul-de-sac location just off Manchester Road in Bury only a short walk to the town centre and all amenities and the Metrolink station. The property has been in the same ownership for the last six decades and of course in that time certain upgrades have been carried out to include combination gas central heating, upvc double glazing and a recently installed bathroom suite.

Briefly the accommodation comprises: Entrance vestibule, inner hall, lounge with living flame fire, sitting room again with living flame fire, kitchen, first floor landing two double bedrooms and a recently installed bathroom with shower. To the outside there are well stocked garden areas to the front and rear.

Stunning open plan kitchen
Two living areas

Long private driveway
Excellent provision for storage
Manchester commuter belt
Motorway and train links around 1.5 miles
Large retail development around 1.5 miles
Potential for further extension
This property has much to offer and has been very thoughtfully renovated both inside and out.
We would anticipate that many potential buyers will see the X Factor of this home as the large rear garden which has been thoughtfully landscaped and includes a number of outbuildings. Additionally, there is a long private driveway and front garden. This plot size would allow scope for further extension yet still allow the home to retain a large garden.
The accommodation has been reconfigured internally and includes a good sized entrance hall with access to a large ground floor storeroom which has been prepared to accommodate a ground floor WC.
There are two living areas both with access to a stunning modern open plan kitchen. To the first floor there are three double bedroom served by an impressive modern bathroom and please note there is also a large loft with two roof lights and the size should allow scope for conversion should this be of interest.
The sellers have expended a lot of time in maintaining the property which over recent years has seen the bathroom refurbished, new central heating radiators throughout, pointing to the front and rear of the property and an Indian stone patio being laid to the rear garden.
Early viewing is highly recommended to appreciate what this property has to offer.
The property is Freehold
Council Tax is Band A - £1,531.45

"Set on one of Holcombe Brook’s most established and highly sought-after roads, this extended five-bedroom period semi pairs timeless character with subtle contemporary style. Just a short stroll from a range of village amenities and glorious countryside walks, it’s a home that offers the very best of both worlds — heritage charm and modern practicality.
Spanning three floors, the generous accommodation includes a spacious entrance hallway, large open-plan kitchen and dining room flowing onto the garden, two further substantial reception rooms, utility, downstairs WC, five bedrooms, two bathrooms and a storeroom. Outside, a private driveway, secluded sunny rear garden, and a versatile detached garden room complete the package.
Period Character &amp; Charm
From the moment you step through the original oak front door, the home’s heritage is evident. The hallway retains beautiful oak panelling and staircase, enhanced by statement tiled flooring. Period features continue throughout, from picture rails to open fires with cast iron surrounds, all set against a premium Farrow &amp; Ball colour palette. The current owners have done a superb job of preserving this charm while subtly upgrading the property to meet modern living standards.
Open-Plan Living
The showpiece of this home is the stunning open-plan kitchen and dining space created by the recent extension. A soaring vaulted ceiling, skylights, and French doors fill the room with natural light and create a seamless connection to the garden — ideal for relaxed summer living and entertaining.
The walnut breakfast bar invites Sunday brunches, while the quartz worktops and minimalist cabinetry keep the look sleek and timeless. A suite of Neff integrated appliances includes a dishwasher, oven and combination oven, five-zone induction hob with extractor, plus full-height fridge and freezer. Whether it’s hosting friends for dinner or enjoying busy family life, this is a space that works beautifully day to day.
Reception Rooms
Two further reception rooms offer flexibility for family life. The rear room opens onto the patio, making a wonderful summer lounge, while the bay-fronted room to the front is perfect for cosy winter evenings by the fire. Both feature traditional chimney breasts and open fireplaces, keeping the home’s character alive.
Practical Spaces
The utility room mirrors the kitchen’s modern styling, with extra worktops, storage, and plumbing for laundry appliances. An external door makes it ideal as a secondary entrance for muddy boots and dogs.
Bedrooms &amp; Bathrooms
Across the first and second floors are five well-proportioned bedrooms, four of which are generous doubles. The fifth, currently used as a home office, enjoys far-reaching views towards Manchester.
On the first floor, the front bedroom boasts a charming mullion window, while the rear enjoys a bay with green garden views. The family bathroom is equally impressive, with a freestanding bath, walk-in shower, basin, and WC set against coordinating wall and floor tiles.
The second floor is perfect for a teenager or guest suite, with a spacious double bedroom under sloped ceilings and skylights, plus an adjacent shower room with a modern three-piece suite.
Outside Space
To the front, a large driveway with EV charging point is framed by mature planting, giving excellent kerb appeal. The south-westerly rear garden is a true suntrap from midday to evening, with two patios — one for al-fresco dining, the other for lounging — plus a central lawn, mature borders, and fruit and vegetable planters for green-fingered buyers.
The detached garden studio, complete with power, lighting, and hot/cold water, is an adaptable space for a home office, gym, bar, or hobby room.
Location
Holcombe Brook is one of Ramsbottom’s most desirable areas, offering a warm village feel with the convenience of excellent local amenities.

Hunters are proud to present this exceptional six-bedroom detached substantial Victorian villa, believed to have been built circa 1860 by the Apsell Family, owners of the former Tonge Mill. The residence is perfectly positioned opposite Limefield Park on the sought-after Manchester Old Road and less than 3 minutes walk to Alkrington Woods Nature Reserve which offers over 120 acres of mature woodland, meadows, rivers and fishing lodges.
Thoughtfully restored and redesigned by the current owners, the home exemplifies superior craftsmanship and attention to detail throughout. Offered with no chain and freehold tenure, this distinctive property seamlessly blends period features with high-quality modern upgrades and expansive, beautifully maintained grounds — an ideal home for large or growing families.
Upon entering, a grand hallway with original flooring and high ceilings sets a welcoming tone. Two elegant front reception rooms, both bathed in natural light from large bay windows and side windows featuring original wooden shutters, offer ideal spaces for entertaining or relaxing. Continuing through the hallway, you'll find a spacious dining room with traditional wooden flooring, perfect for hosting large gatherings.
The ground floor also boasts a well-equipped kitchen and breakfast area, complete with premium appliances, which connects to a separate, self-contained annex. This additional living space includes a second kitchen, bathroom, lounge and a double bedroom — ideal for extended family or guests. The annex is easily separated / combined into the main residence with two lockable internal doors.
A stylish garden room at the rear of the property overlooks the garden, while a convenient downstairs WC completes the ground floor.
Upstairs, the traditional landing leads to five large bedrooms. The standout master suite features a duplex design, with a spiral staircase leading to a private upper level that includes a lounge (with ideal work from home office space), bathroom featuring twin bathtubs, and separate shower room — perfect for modern living.
A spacious family bathroom, a Jack &amp; Jill shower room, and an en-suite to one of the bedrooms ensure convenience and comfort for all.
For added versatility, the property includes a large basement divided into three rooms — offering excellent potential for conversion into games / entertainment spaces or an additional self-contained living space.
Additionally, a separate log cabin, currently used as an exercise studio and office, benefits from a shower &amp; WC, electricity and ethernet connections.
Outside, the rear garden offers a private oasis, tastefully landscaped with a mix of lawn and decking, and includes a hot tub area. The front of the property features a large driveway providing ample off-road parking.

"Tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac in the sought-after village of Egerton, this deceptively spacious three-storey semi offers far more living space than your average semi-detached home. Recently upgraded with a brand-new kitchen and new roof in 2024, it combines modern comfort with stunning panoramic views over open countryside. Perfectly suited for family life, the layout includes a welcoming entrance hall, full-depth living room, spacious open-plan kitchen/dining room, home office, conservatory/utility, three bedrooms, and a family bathroom. Outside, the garage and under-garage basement provide exceptional storage, while the south-westerly garden captures the sun all afternoon through to spectacular sunsets.
Living Space
Step inside to a generous entrance hall with plenty of space for coats, shoes, and everyday essentials, keeping the rest of the home clutter-free.
On the upper ground floor, the full-length living room offers a rare sense of scale, with large windows at both ends filling the room with natural light. From the rear, the window perfectly frames those breathtaking countryside views. The space is styled with a contemporary finish, complemented by a traditional chimney breast, oak mantel, and decorative inlet for added charm.
Also on this level, a dedicated home office/study provides a quiet corner to work or focus, away from the busier heart of the home.
On the lower ground floor, the impressive open-plan kitchen and dining room is the social hub, complete with underfloor heating for year-round comfort. The kitchen’s timeless yet modern design features integrated appliances, including a double oven, microwave, fridge-freezer, dishwasher, and a four-ring hob with concealed extractor. The breakfast bar seats four, while the spacious dining area is perfect for family meals and entertaining guests. The room flows into the conservatory/utility, leading directly out to the garden for easy indoor-outdoor living.
Bedrooms &amp; Bathroom
Upstairs, three well-proportioned bedrooms make the most of the home’s elevated position, with the rear bedrooms enjoying those same incredible scenic views. The family bathroom offers a blank canvas for a modern update to your own taste and style.
Outside Space
To the front, a private drive and garage provide easy parking, with the garage basement adding valuable extra storage.
The rear garden is a great highlight, south-westerly facing to catch the sun from midday until evening, with a raised decking area for relaxing, dining, and entertaining against the backdrop of breathtaking sunsets over Winter Hill. Below, the lawn offers space for children to play or for green-fingered owners to create their ideal garden retreat.
Location
Despite the peaceful, elevated setting, you’re just moments from the heart of Egerton village and only a short drive to Bromley Cross. Both offer an excellent choice of pubs, restaurants, shops, and highly regarded schools and nurseries.
For outdoor lovers, the surrounding countryside, reservoirs, and West Pennine Moors provide endless opportunities for walking, cycling, running, and sailing.
Commuters benefit from quick access to the A666 for motorway connections, while Bromley Cross Train Station — around five minutes’ drive — offers direct services into central Manchester.

"Five bedrooms
Edwardian residence
An elite style of presentation
Four receptions
Meticulous gardens
Gated sweeping driveway
Exquisite kitchen
Laundry and Utility
Three bathrooms
Exceptional and large gardens
A beautifully imposing Edwardian detached residence, magnificently set within its own grounds, and quite possibly being one of the finest homes within the area.
The Old Vicarage is nicely nestled at the end of St Barnabas Drive with meticulously prepared gardens, gated sweeping driveway and a 'tip of the hat' to some amazing views of the local and surrounding countryside.
This is undoubtedly a gorgeous family home, where perhaps anyone who has business in Manchester or indeed Leeds, can easily 'return home' to a place that sits within the countryside and yet boasts a positioning that enjoys a convenient connection to the highly desirable centre of Littleborough Village where boutique clothes and coffee shops await. The countryside is also quite literally on the doorstep making a quick escape into the hills very easy indeed, and if commuting is your thing, the train links from here are superb.
This enigmatic dwelling has a style and an elite quality that seems to lavishly exude from everywhere and it is clearly evident that every detail from 'décor' to 'flow' has been immensely and professionally considered.
A brief insight into this exceptional and individual home further includes:
Ground floor – As you enter the property the large vestibule with original doors and ornate windows instantly welcomes you. There is a traditional cloaks room to the side. The reception hall has a returning stair case with a spindled balustrade to the first floor gallery style landing. The receptions are perfectly designed and decorated to enhance a function for each room as each one echoes its own personality. The study is already set for business as you will see. The sitting room is somewhere to put your feet up, and enjoy the roaring fire. The day lounge is again a place where the family may gather to catch up after the evening meal, still enjoying the sumptuous theme and with perhaps a more modern flair. From this lounge is access into the sun room with bi-folding doors, which is perfect if you are entertaining or is just the best place for an early morning coffee. The breakfast kitchen which is accessed from the hall and the sun room, is beautifully fitted with a breath taking selection of wall and base units, in-built appliances and matching Corian work surfaces. From here is access into the Utility and Laundry Room and personal access into the large double garage. Within here is a separate gym and a separate w.c.
First floor – the spacious and light galleried landing leads very nicely into each of the five double bedrooms and the two family bathrooms. As with the ground floor every detail has certainly been brushed with a professional eye. The Master Bedroom has been tastefully fitted with an exceptional level of quality furniture with a window seat to the bay. Bedroom number two enjoys its own en-suite bathroom and the house bathroom comprises of a luxury four piece suite. The guest bathroom is slightly smaller and still enjoys a sumptuous three piece suite.
Externally – at the front is the gravelled sweeping driveway with electronic security gated entrance. The gardens are meticulous and range from the traditional lawn with mature shrubbery borders, to a Zen style area. There is composite decking just from the garden room that currently leads to the large hot tub.
Please note the property has solar panels and our client informs that there is a saving of approximately £2,500 per year.

A deceptively spacious mid-terraced cottage set in an enviable position just a short walk to the sought-after village of Delph. An ideal family home, viewing comes highly recommended. EPC: Tbc.
Set behind beautifully tended and substantial gardens, this charming home offers almost 1,500 square feet of accommodation, making it an ideal choice for family purchasers looking for additional space both internally and externally.

A farmhouse style kitchen features a composite sink, range cooker and ample worktop space, and the large dining room features double doors leading out the well-stocked and mature garden.
The large and welcoming lounge features mullion windows, exposed stone &amp; brick fireplace and 'parquet' style wooden flooring, all helping to blend tradition into modern living.
To the first floor viewers will find three bedrooms, all of which are good-sized double rooms, and a family bathroom comprising of a hand-wash basin and panelled bath with shower over. The WC is adjacent to bathroom, and a useful storage room containing the boiler and plumbed for a washing machine completes the accommodation.
Benefitting from Smart heating controls, the property is warmed by an 'Ideal Logic+' combination boiler and well-maintained hardwood double glazed windows enhance the economy and comfort further.
Externally to the rear there is off-road parking for up to three vehicles, two storage sheds and steps to an upper seating area with further shed and wood store. No public access across the property makes it private and pleasant enhancement.
To the front, the mature and substantial enclosed garden benefits from both lawn and patio areas, including a multitude of shrubs and plants ensuring almost year-round colour. A growers paradise, the vegetable garden features a variety of plants, herbs and fruit trees, including gooseberry &amp; blueberry bushes, apple &amp; pear trees, rhubarb, strawberries and lemon balm. The owners have also been able to grow a wide variety of herbs and vegetables in the raised beds, including brassicas, pulses, garlic, onions and potatoes, whilst using a greenhouse to produce tomatoes, coriander and other herbs.
Delph Lodge can be located just off Huddersfield Road on the fringes of the popular village of Delph in Saddleworth. With trendy pubs, cafés and wine bars within walking distance, the property is also ideal for easy access to neighbouring villages including Dobcross, Diggle and Uppermill and as such, this would prove an ideal choice.

Stamp Duty
Residential property rates
You usually pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (sdlt) on increasing portions of the property price when you buy residential property, for example a house or flat.
The amount you pay depends on:
• when you bought the property
• how much you paid for it
• whether you’re eligible for relief or an exemption
Rates for a single property
You pay sdlt at these rates if, after buying the property, it is the only residential property you own.
You will usually pay 5% on top of these rates if you own another residential property.
Rates from 1 April 2025
Property or lease premium or transfer value sdlt rate
Up to £125,000 Zero
The next £125,000 (the portion from £125,001 to £250,000) 2%
The next £675,000 (the portion from £250,001 to £925,000) 5%
The next £575,000 (the portion from £925,001 to £1.5 million) 10%
The remaining amount (the portion above £1.5 million) 12%
Example
In April 2025 you buy a house for £295,000. The sdlt you owe will be calculated as follows:
• 0% on the first £125,000 = £0
• 2% on the second £125,000 = £2,500
• 5% on the final £45,000 = £2,250
• total sdlt = £4,750

"The Pump House is an impressive fusion of contemporary architecture, luxury family living, and peaceful sanctuary — all wrapped in over 7,000 sq ft of exceptional space and nestled within 4.5 acres of private grounds. Elevated above a tranquil wooded valley with landscaped gardens cascading down to the river below, this magnificent home offers unrivalled privacy, awe-inspiring design, and a standard of living that must be seen to be fully appreciated.
From the tree-lined driveway and bold architectural form to the exquisite interiors, bedroom suites, designer kitchen, multiple reception rooms, home cinema, indoor swimming pool and home gym — this is family life at its most refined. Located just moments from the amenities of Standish village, acclaimed schools, and key transport links, The Pump House is a home that delivers the very best of both worlds.
An Impressive Approach
The house is so discreetly positioned that if nobody told you it was here, you’d never know it existed. Accessed via electric gates, a tree-lined driveway opens to landscaped grounds and reveals the home in all its grandeur — perfectly framed by lush greenery and manicured lawns.
The main parking area is large enough for a whole fleet of cars, and the home welcomes you inside through a supersize bespoke solid oak door with glass surrounds, giving you the first impression of the grand proportions found throughout. A handy porch leads through to the central reception hall where you immediately notice the stylish oak and glass staircase, plus the abundance of natural light pouring in through the huge skylight window and glass wall at the rear.
The Designer Kitchen
The heart of the home is the exceptional designer kitchen and daily dining area — a breathtaking space with plentiful glass and panoramic views of the gardens and valley below. Bifold doors and three sets of French doors open onto a vast elevated composite deck, creating seamless indoor-outdoor living.
Designed and installed by the renowned Stuart Frazer, this premium Siematic kitchen features minimalist cabinetry, ambient recessed lighting, and deep Corian worktops. Every detail has been considered — from the walk-in pantry to the well-tailored storage and integral larder cabinets.
A selection of Miele appliances includes two conventional ovens with warming drawers, a microwave, steam oven, full-length fridge and dishwasher. Additional highlights include a Bora induction hob with built-in downdraft extractor, a Quooker tap with instant boiling, chilled and sparkling water, a Liebherr full-length freezer, and twin Monogram wine fridges.
At the centre is an enormous island with a contrasting dark oak breakfast bar — a stunning and practical hub for everyday family life, relaxed weekends, or entertaining. Whether it's Sunday brunch, evening drinks with friends, or summer barbecues spilling out onto the decking, this space is made to be enjoyed.
Reception Rooms
The Pump House offers four distinct reception rooms, each delivering space, comfort, and flexibility for the modern family.
The main lounge is a showstopper — around 33 sq m in size, with a vaulted double-height ceiling, six-panel bifold doors, and a stylish glass inset log burner within a towering chimney breast and gallery landing above. It’s a room made for hosting on a grand scale or unwinding in total comfort.
Next door, the media room offers another luxurious lounge experience, with floor-to-ceiling windows by day and a full cinema set-up by night — blackout blinds, projector screen, and surround sound at the touch of a button. It’s ideal as a cinema, games room or teenage retreat.
On the opposite side of the reception hall, the formal dining room enjoys an abundance of natural light, with French doors opening onto a covered al-fresco dining terrace. Perfect for dinner parties and special occasions, it blends elegance with atmosphere.
Adjoining the kitchen is a peaceful day lounge — currently a relaxed sitting room with more French doors onto the garden. It’s the perfect spot for morning coffee, a children's playroom, or a snug for reading and relaxation.
Practical Aspects
Functionality is fully considered, with a separate plant room, utility, guest WC, ample cloak storage, and a large, fully equipped home office designed for two people. A unique bonus is the first-floor laundry room — located near the bedrooms and complete with plumbing, sink, and generous storage.
Bedrooms &amp; Bathrooms
The entire first floor benefits from vaulted ceilings and striking architectural lines. Full-height apex windows and walls of glass frame tranquil green views from every room.
Each of the five double bedrooms has its own sleek three-piece en-suite with tiled surrounds and modern fittings, all immaculately maintained. The master suite adds a walk-in dressing room and a stunning private balcony beneath an apex roof — your own peaceful morning sanctuary just steps from the bed.
Leisure Facilities
The indoor swimming pool is a standout feature, newly refurbished and upgraded with a Calorex system in 2025. Enjoy year-round heated swimming with a swim-jet system for endless laps, plus a hot tub, skylights, floor-to-ceiling windows, and bifold doors connecting you back to the neighbouring nature.
Accessed via a covered walkway from the house and also from the first floor via a spiral staircase, it’s a true private spa experience. A home gym links the gallery landing to the pool hall — equally suited to yoga or conversion into a wellness suite or sauna.
A Luxury Finish
From the moment you enter, the luxury is unmistakable — bespoke oak joinery and flooring, natural stone tiling, gallery landings, vast proportions, and world-class appliances throughout.
A Control4 smart home system allows you to manage lighting, heating, and audio from your phone, delivering comfort and convenience with every touch.
Gardens, Grounds &amp; Garages
Set on approximately 4.5 acres with no neighbours in sight, this is more than a home — it's a countryside retreat. The gated driveway delivers complete seclusion and leads to a shale-surfaced parking area, triple garage, and carport with EV charging point.
To the rear, a full-width composite deck with glass balustrades offers a breath-taking entertaining space overlooking the valley and river. It’s piled into the ground for structural integrity and generously sized to accommodate sun loungers, dining zones, or even an outdoor kitchen if desired.
The surrounding grounds include manicured lawns, landscaped borders, rockeries, and mature trees. To one side, Japanese-inspired tiered lawns step down to a large wildlife pond, offering a magical connection to the river and nature. A children’s treehouse completes the picture — making this a truly special home for every generation.
Location
Despite its extraordinary privacy, The Pump House is just moments from the bustling and sought-after village of Standish — home to a wide selection of independent shops, cafes, restaurants, gyms, supermarkets, and top-rated schools.
The M6 motorway is a short drive away, placing Manchester, Preston, and the wider North West within easy commuting distance. This rare combination of peace, privacy, and connectivity makes the location just as impressive as the home itself.

Whilst we retain responsibility for ensuring checks and any ongoing monitoring are carried out correctly, the initial checks are carried out on our behalf by Lifetime Legal who will contact you once you have had an offer accepted on a property you wish to buy. The cost of these checks is £65 (incl. VAT), which covers the cost of obtaining relevant data and any manual checks and monitoring which might be required. This fee will need to be paid by you in advance of us issuing a memorandum of sale, directly to Lifetime Legal, and is non-refundable. We will receive some of the fee taken by Lifetime Legal to compensate for its role in the provision of these checks.

Spacious 4-Bedroom Stone Farmhouse In A Idyllic Rural Edgworth Setting
Birches Farm Cottage – A Most Unique Setting
Tucked just off Bury Road, close to the picturesque village of Edgworth, Birches Farm Cottage is a honey-hued semi-detached stone farmhouse where timeless character meets modern living. Framed by open countryside, its glass-roofed conservatory captures sweeping views across rolling fields, while the gardens – a blend of manicured lawns, vibrant borders, and stone pathways – offer peaceful corners to pause and take in the surroundings.
The approach sets the scene. A gentle climb along a farm track, edged with open green fields and drystone walls, draws you deeper into rural life. Passing through the working farmyard, the air carries the scent of hay and the occasional sound of livestock, a reminder of the home’s agricultural setting. Beyond the old stone gateposts and cattle grid, the paved driveway and integral double garage mark your arrival at this welcoming home.
Where Character Meets Comfort
Step inside the covered portico entrance into a bright, contemporary hallway, complete with a handy cloakroom cupboard and direct access to the garage. The warmth of the timber front door, the herringbone flooring, and the overall light and airy feel immediately set the tone – this is a home that respects its heritage while embracing a stylish, modern finish.
A Lounge for All Seasons
To the left lies the award-winning, magazine-featured lounge – a showpiece of style and comfort. A rustic double-sided stone fireplace with wood-burning stove anchors one wall, adding warmth and character. Soft recessed lighting casts a gentle glow over white walls, oak doors, and the stone-flagged floor that flows throughout the ground floor. Generous picture windows frame the surrounding greenery, creating a connection with the outdoors, while the spacious layout offers the flexibility for cosy evenings or larger gatherings. Integrated ceiling speakers in both the lounge and the kitchen enhance everyday living and entertaining, offering seamless, high-quality audio throughout the social heart of the home
Dining with a Sense of Occasion
The dining room is full of character, with flagstone flooring under centuries-old oak beams. The double-sided fireplace forms a striking focal point, perfect for lingering over candlelit dinners. A wide picture window overlooks the garden, bringing the changing seasons into every mealtime. Above, the double-height section reveals the oak staircase, complete with cleverly integrated storage beneath, linking the two floors with light and openness.
The Heart of the Home – Kitchen &amp; Conservatory
The kitchen/breakfast room is designed to be both functional and inviting. Soft grey cabinetry with brushed brass handles pairs with warm wood worktops, while a range-style cooker sits beneath a concealed extractor, framed by rustic herringbone tiling. Integrated appliances include an oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, dishwasher, wine cooler, and a farmhouse-style sink perfectly placed beneath a window to take in the countryside views.
A breakfast bar seating four creates the ideal spot for casual dining, morning coffee, or catching up with friends. From here, a door opens to the conservatory – a light-filled space with glass walls and a vaulted roof that blurs the boundary between indoors and out. In summer, it’s bathed in sunshine with garden scents drifting in; in winter, the underfloor heating beneath the tiled floor keeps it warm and inviting, making it a peaceful place to watch frost settle over the fields. French doors lead directly onto the terrace.
A useful downstairs WC is located off the kitchen lobby.
The garage, also accommodates the washing machine and serves as a practical laundry area, keeping day-to-day chores neatly out of sight.
Upstairs – Four Bedrooms and Countryside Calm
The oak staircase leads to a vaulted landing filled with light from Velux windows, creating an airy welcome to the upper floor.
Bedroom One –
 The main bedroom enjoys far-reaching views from four windows, fitted wardrobes, and a feature oak-slat wall detail. The en-suite includes a double shower with glazed screen, vanity sink with mirror, WC, and marble-effect tiling to walls and floor.
Bedroom Two –
 A spacious double with a front-facing outlook, blue panelled feature wall, and built-in wardrobes.
Bedroom Three –
 Overlooking the side garden, decorated in soft pink to half height with a charming exposed beam behind the bed.
Bedroom Four –
 Currently a nursery, with a sage-painted feature wall and a view over the front.
A Bathroom Designed for Comfort and Style
The family bathroom combines practicality with a sense of luxury. Large marble-effect tiles flow from floor to ceiling, reflecting light beautifully. A wall-hung toilet, contemporary vanity with warm wood countertop, and countertop basin with chrome mixer tap set the scene. An illuminated circular mirror adds soft ambience, complemented by recessed shelving. The bath, with rainfall shower over, invites both quick refreshes and long, indulgent soaks. A chrome heated towel rail and thoughtful design touches complete the space.
Gardens and Outlook
The gardens are a perfect marriage of open space, mature planting, and uninterrupted views. Lawns sweep around the property, bordered by established shrubs, seasonal flowers, and well-tended beds. A paved terrace alongside the conservatory offers a sunny spot for morning coffee or evening drinks, while stone pathways link different seating areas.
A raised planting bed adds colour and structure, and a firepit area provides a cosy place to gather. Climbing plants soften timber and stone boundaries, while hedges offer privacy without interrupting the expansive views. From every vantage point, the rolling hills stretch into the distance – vibrant in summer, golden in autumn, and softly frosted in winter.
In the Village
Edgworth offers a thriving community with everyday essentials and a welcoming atmosphere. Within walking distance, you’ll find a post office, village shop, butcher, two cafes, a hairdresser, and a beautician. The village also boasts a cricket club, 4G football pitches, and the much-loved Holden’s &amp; Co ice cream shop.
For dining, try the new gastropub at The Spread Eagle or the traditional charm of The White Horse and The Black Bull. Nearby Ramsbottom offers an even wider choice of restaurants and bars, just 10 minutes away.
Edgworth Primary School is rated ‘Good’ by Ofsted, with secondary options at Turton School and Canon Slade, both also rated ‘Good’. Buses also run to Bury Grammar and Bolton independent schools.
For outdoor pursuits, the scenic Wayoh and Entwistle reservoirs are close by, along with the village park. Commuters benefit from excellent road links, with the M65 just 15 minutes away, and Bolton or Bury reachable in around 20 minutes.

Exclusivity Fee:
You can secure the purchase today by paying an exclusivity fee of £2,000 which gives you the rights to purchase within a given timeframe. The exclusivity fee is returned to you upon successful completion of the property.
A processing fee of £200 is required in order to draw up an exclusive legally binding contract between the buyer and seller. This gives the buyer exclusive rights to purchase within a pre-agreed timeframe.
Paying this fee ensures that the seller takes their property off the market and reserves it exclusively for you, therefore eliminating the risk of gazumping and aborted costs.

The Pack Horse, Nelson Square, Bradshawgate, Bolton, Bl1 1Aq
Earn instant income on this already tenanted student investment opportunity - cash buyers only! Just 10 minutes walk to The University of Bolton! Excellent investment opportunity in hugely popular student development.
This stunning ensuite student room apartment is fully furnished and includes a bed, en-suite with shower and access to a communal kitchen kitchen. It's easy to see why The Pack Horse has proven popular with Bolton's influx of students, offering a fantastic range of on-site facilities including a fully-equipped gym and a modern common room with pool tables, pinball machines, video games and even a large projector screen for movie nights, making it incredibly easy for residents to relax, unwind and socialise. Residents also benefit from secure bicycle storage, CCTV in the communal areas, a concierge reception service and laundry facilities.
The Pack Horse is a beautiful period building that was once the prestigious Pack Horse Hotel, which was transformed in 2012 to create the ultimate boutique student living experience. Located on Bradshawgate, only a 10 minute walk away from the University of Bolton, The Pack Horse has everything that Bolton has to offer on its doorstep! Bradshawgate is home to most of Bolton's bars and restaurants, alongside the recently renovated Market Place shopping centre and the newly opened Vaults which contains numerous restaurants and high street shops. It's no surprise that The Pack Horse is one of the most sought after developments in Bolton!
The University of Bolton has around 14,000 students, with over 8,000 living and travelling from areas outside the North West region. Unlike the close neighbours of Liverpool and Manchester, virtually no Purpose-Built Student Accommodation exists in the immediate area, with a housing problem lagging some way behind the ambitious ongoing development plans of the University of Bolton. Now is the perfect time to invest in Bolton's student accommodation!

Important Notice:
For each Lot, a contract documentation fee of £1,500 (inclusive of VAT) is payable to Barnard Marcus Auctions by the buyer. The seller may charge additional fees payable upon completion. If applicable, such fees are detailed within the Special Conditions of Sale. Buyers are deemed to bid in full knowledge of this.
The Guide Price quoted must not be relied upon by prospective purchasers as a valuation or assessment of value of the property. It is intended to provide purchasers with an indication of the region at which the reserve may be set at the time of going to press. The guide price may be subject to variation and interested parties are advised to make regular checks for variations and should be aware that the reserve price may be either below or above the quoted guide price.
Prospective purchasers should also be aware that the eventual sale price may be above or below the guide level dependent upon competition, and should therefore not presume the guide to be indicative of the final expected sale price or the price the property is available at.
When setting the guide price, the auctioneers have given consideration to the seller’s instructions in respect of their indicated reserve price at the time of instruction. The reserve price, (the level below which the property will not be sold), remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer. The guide price therefore, is intended to indicate the region at which the reserve price is intended to be set. The seller will confirm their final reserve price close to the auction date and if appropriate the auctioneers may adjust the guide price to reflect this.
Whilst Barnard Marcus make every effort to ensure the safety and security of viewers at properties, we have not carried out a detailed Health &amp; Safety inspection of properties in our auctions and cannot therefore guarantee the safety and security of viewers.
Prospective purchasers and bidders attend properties entirely at their own risk. Particular care should be taken when accessing cellars, attics, exterior grounds and outbuildings and boundaries. All non-conducted inspections of vacant sites should be made in daylight hours only and entry into such sites is entirely at the viewers risk.

On the ground floor are three reception rooms, a kitchen, shower room, and boiler/utility room. Upstairs there are four bedrooms and a bathroom.

• A Planning Application has been approved under Section 19 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 to amend the approved proposals for the conversion of a traditional agricultural building into three residential dwellings (Ref: 106995/lbc/22).
• The original scheme, which was granted with Listed Building Consent, includes the sensitive restoration and conversion of the building into three characterful homes (Use Class C3), along with associated external works, private amenity space, and parking provision. The project also involves the removal of more modern structures on the site, including a steel-framed agricultural building, a shed, and a car port, relocating two of the approved parking spaces to better integrate with the site layout and heritage context, enhancing the landscaping scheme, with additional planting to further soften the development and support local biodiversity

"Three-bedroom detached home in sought-after Garswood location
Full back-to-brick renovation required throughout
Ideal development project or opportunity to create a dream home
Ground floor with porch, hall, kitchen, dining room, living room, and bedroom
First floor with two large double bedrooms and family bathroom
Front and rear gardens plus driveway and single garage
Excellent transport links via Garswood Train Station and M6 motorway
Close to well-regarded schools and open green spaces
Detailed Description
Located on the ever-popular Rectory Road in Garswood, this three-bedroom detached property represents an exceptional opportunity for those with vision, creativity, and a passion for transformation. In need of a full back-to-brick renovation throughout, the home offers endless potential either as a rewarding development project or the foundation for creating a truly bespoke family residence. The generous plot and well-proportioned rooms provide an excellent canvas, with the current ground floor layout comprising a porch, welcoming entrance hall, kitchen, dining room, living room, and a versatile downstairs bedroom. Upstairs, there are two spacious double bedrooms and a bathroom. Outside, the property enjoys gardens to both the front and rear, a driveway providing off-road parking, and a single garage.
Due to the property’s condition, it is unlikely that traditional mortgage finance will be available, and we strongly recommend viewing the virtual tour before arranging a physical visit. Garswood itself is a desirable residential area within Ashton-in-Makerfield, cherished for its close-knit community, well-regarded local schools, and excellent access to open green spaces. For commuters, the location is superb - Garswood Train Station is just moments away, and the M6 motorway is within easy reach, offering swift connections to Liverpool, Manchester, and beyond. This is a rare chance to acquire a property with such scope in one of the area’s most sought-after locations.

Set in a quiet cul-de-sac on Willow Bank, this four-bedroom home has a warm and welcoming feel from the moment you arrive.
The driveway offers plenty of space for off-road parking and stepping through the porch into the generous entrance hall, you’ll instantly get a sense of the space and light that runs throughout the property.

The open-plan kitchen and dining area is a real heart-of-the-home space – somewhere to gather over breakfast or host a lively dinner with friends. The large lounge feels inviting and comfortable, ideal for cosy evenings in. There’s also a handy downstairs W/C, a separate utility room to keep things organised, and access to the garage, which is large enough to accommodate a car as well as provide extra storage or hobby space. The garage also features a fitted EV charging point, making it ready for electric vehicle owners.
Upstairs, there are four well-proportioned bedrooms, offering plenty of flexibility whether you need family rooms, guest space, or a home office. Two of the bedrooms benefit from fitted wardrobes, adding to the home’s excellent storage. The large family bathroom features a four-piece suite, providing both a bath and a separate shower. For anyone needing even more storage, the fully boarded loft is a huge bonus – ideal for keeping everything neatly out of sight but close to hand.
The location is hard to beat. Willow Bank sits within the catchment for some of Cheadle Hulme’s most sought-after schools, making it a great choice for families.

"Welcome to Victory Grove in Audenshaw. A highly sought-after location, home to an array of beautiful properties and set on a quiet estate with no through access, keeping traffic and disturbance to a minimum.
This stunning three-bedroom detached home occupies a generous plot and instantly captivates with its exceptional kerb appeal. The front driveway/garden is beautifully maintained and provides ample parking for up to 4 cars, while the modern grey frontage, complementary rendered exterior, and stylish entrance door combine to create a sleek, contemporary look that speaks of the care and attention to detail lavished on this property. Stepping inside, the same level of thought and refinement is immediately apparent. The welcoming entrance hallway sets the tone for the rest of the home, offering space for guests to be greeted and for coats and shoes to be neatly stored in a well-lit and useful under-stairs storage space while serving as a central hub connecting the stairs and the main ground floor rooms which have been stylishly laid in luxury vinyl flooring seamlessly flowing through the ground floor space.
The lounge is an inviting and versatile space, bathed in natural light from two tall windows and offering flexibility in layout thanks to its generous proportions, all while providing a charming view of the private rear garden. The second reception room, currently used as a dining area and bar and with well-designed, floor-to-ceiling storage cupboards along one wall, is another adaptable space that could be tailored to suit a variety of needs—whether as a formal dining room, home office, playroom, or additional entertaining area. The kitchen, truly the heart of the home, exudes elegance and practicality in equal measure, with premium features including concealed pop-up outlets, a Quooker tap, exquisite work surfaces, and top-quality finishes that make it ideal for both everyday family life and entertaining. A conveniently located downstairs WC, maintained to the same immaculate standard as the rest of the property, completes the ground floor.
Upstairs, three double bedrooms await. The master bedroom offers a sense of luxury with its spacious layout, bespoke fitted storage that surrounds the bed, and high-end touches such as matching hardware and integrated lighting, all while comfortably accommodating a king-size bed without compromising space. The second bedroom is equally generous, boasting extensive built-in storage across two walls, while the third bedroom, currently used as a home office, offers ample flexibility to serve as a bedroom, nursery, playroom, or home gym. The family bathroom continues the home’s premium feel, presenting a bright, modern design with a shower unit, toilet, and sink basin in a high-quality finish.
To the rear, the enclosed garden is an oasis of both relaxation and entertainment. The landscaped design reflects the same attention to detail as the interior, with durable surfacing matching the wraparound driveway for year-round usability. A summer house, canopied seating area, and a beautifully presented hot tub setup make this the perfect space for hosting or enjoying quiet evenings outdoors. For keen gardeners, the vibrant planting offers plenty of opportunity for enjoyment, while the garage provides a dry, well-finished space with plentiful electrical outlets—ideal for storage, hobbies, or as a practical workspace.

Butterwick Fields is a modern development located between Horwich and Blackrod and has excellent access to Blackrod train station which is on the mainline to Manchester. The modern development has achieved consistent rates of sale over the years and in particular this home, which is located close to Star Lodge is classed as one of the strongest positions within the development.
For those not familiar with the town, Horwich has a small centre with a good variety of largely independently owned shops and services together with cafes, pubs and restaurants. A consistently strong feature of the town is the surrounding countryside which includes a stretch of the West Pennine moors and a number of reservoirs, whilst the nearby village of Adlington plays host to a stretch of the Leeds Liverpool canal. This balance of surrounding countryside yet convenient access to the aforementioned train station and also links to the M61 attract many people to settle within the area.

A spacious and extended two-bedroom semi-detached home in a popular residential area of Swinton, offering excellent potential for modernisation. Featuring a single-storey rear extension, generous driveway, double garage, and both front and rear garde
Nestled within a well-established residential area of Swinton, this extended brick-built semi-detached property offers a fantastic opportunity for buyers seeking a home with scope to personalise. Set on a generous plot, it boasts a double driveway, double garage, and both front and rear gardens, making it an ideal choice for those looking for a home with space and potential.
The property has been extended to the rear with a single-storey addition, creating a more spacious dining and reception area that complements the main living space. Internally, the home features two bedrooms, a family bathroom, and a bright main lounge. A new boiler was installed around two years ago, and while the home is fully functional and benefits from double glazing throughout, it would benefit from modernisation and general cosmetic attention to bring it up to date.
The rear garden offers a private outdoor space with side access and plenty of room for planting or landscaping, while the double garage provides excellent additional parking or workshop potential.
The surrounding area is popular with families and commuters alike. Several well-rated schools are located nearby, including Co-op Academy Swinton and St. Mary's rc Primary School, both within easy reach. For commuters, the property is ideally situated with access to the A580 East Lancashire Road and nearby Swinton railway station offering quick links into Manchester city centre. Regular bus services also operate along Chorley Road and surrounding routes.
Local amenities include a range of shops, cafes, and supermarkets, as well as Swinton Square Shopping Centre. Residents also benefit from proximity to green spaces such as Victoria Park and Clifton Country Park, perfect for weekend walks, cycling, or time with family outdoors.
With great transport links, schools, and a strong sense of community, this semi-detached property presents an ideal renovation project or long-term home in a desirable and well-connected location.

A home, which is located in a particularly convenient position, allowing superb access to both motorway and train links. Both junction 6 of the M61 and Horwich Parkway train station are around 1 mile away. There is also excellent access to both primary and secondary schools.
The area is equally ideal for access to nearby amenities which include a large retail development which is around half a mile away, whilst Horwich Centre is around 1.5 miles away.
The area is conveniently placed for the excellent outdoor facilities the town has on offer. A simple satellite view of the location nicely illustrates this. Georges Lane for example which is a primary route towards Rivington Pike and the surrounding hills is around 1.5 miles away. A footpath leads from the top of Austins Lane itself into open fields. The town includes a nice variety of sports facilities including rackets and sports clubs, gyms and golf courses etc.
In summary, the area has long been well regarded largely due to the excellent balance of access to amenities countryside and transport links alike and we would certainly recommend an early viewing.

High-quality presentation throughout
Stunning open plan dining kitchen
Large primary living room with media wall and fire
A large home which is presented to a fantastic standard throughout and in one of the premier locations within this popular development.
Positioned fronting Star Lodge the private aspect should allow the home to stand out from the crowd and the property enjoys varying views over the seasons.
A particularly strong characteristic to this design are the bedrooms which are all double sizes and the master itself runs the full depth of the dwelling and is able to include both dressing area and ensuite. In some similar designs we have seen an additional bathroom installed to the second floor should this be needed.
The ground floor has been reconfigured from the original layout and includes a stunning dining kitchen with a number of integral appliances and the primary living space similar to the ensuite runs the full depth of the home and includes an aspect to both the front and rear and houses a fantastic media wall plus contemporary fire.

Important Information For Successful Buyers
We are required by law to conduct anti-money laundering checks on all those buying a property. Whilst we retain responsibility for ensuring checks and any ongoing monitoring are carried out correctly, the initial checks are carried out on our behalf by Lifetime Legal who will contact you once you have had an offer accepted on a property you wish to buy. The cost of these checks is £65 (incl. VAT), which covers the cost of obtaining relevant data and any manual checks and monitoring which might be required. This fee will need to be paid by you in advance of us issuing a memorandum of sale, directly to Lifetime Legal, and is non-refundable. We will receive some of the fee taken by Lifetime Legal to compensate for its role in the provision of these checks.

Malvern Close is positioned close to Pennine Road and consists of semi-detached and detached properties. The location provides an excellent balance of access to the consistently popular nearby countryside and also towards the transport links that serve the town so well. These links include access to the M61 and two train stations which are situated on the main line to Manchester.
From a commercial aspect Horwich has a 'traditional' town centre with a good number of shops and services and there is also a large out of town retail and leisure complex close to the Toughsheet football stadium. The town includes several nurseries, primary school and secondary schools with education through to a-Level.
All in all, we feel this package on offer is rather family friendly and will no doubt be of particular interest to those people who wish to spend time in and around the hills which form an impressive backdrop to the town.

"Modernised Mid Stone Cottage
Grade II Listed
Full Of Character &amp; Charm
Decorated To A High Standard Throughout
Two Bedrooms
Front &amp; Rear Gardens
Convenient Location
Harvey Street, Smithills, Bolton, Bl1
Looking for a modernised cottage in Smithills?
Tucked away at the end of Harvey Street near Hill Top, you'll find this beautifully refurbished Grade II Listed mid-stone cottage. A charming stone-walled front and gated pathway lead you to the duck egg blue-painted timber front door. The cottage’s façade features mullioned windows framed by elegant stone lintels, offering a picture-perfect, timeless appeal.
Welcome Home
Upon entering through the porch, you're welcomed into a cosy lounge. The room features a stone-painted fireplace with a wood burner stove, serving as a charming focal point. Exposed timber beams enhance the character of the space, while the neutral décor creates a serene atmosphere. Oak laminate flooring, which matches the internal doors, adds warmth and continuity throughout.
The lounge windows are fitted with Venetian blinds, offering flexible control over natural light and privacy.
Connected to the lounge is the kitchen/diner, where the rustic charm continues with exposed ceiling beams. The kitchen is fitted with cream Shaker-style wall and base cabinets, offering a timeless, elegant look. Timber worktops add a touch of sophistication, including a breakfast bar that seats two.
Blending practicality with style, the kitchen features modern amenities such as an integrated oven with a 4-ring gas hob and stainless steel extractor above, plumbing for a washing machine, and a stainless steel sink and drainer positioned by the rear window. There's also space for a freestanding American-style fridge/freezer.
Green 'Metro' tiles serve as the splashback, paired with neutral tiled flooring and walls, creating a clean, polished finish. A door leads out to the rear garden, perfect for easy outdoor access.
Ascend the staircase to the first floor, where two bedrooms await. The front-facing bedroom echoes the lounge, featuring matching mullioned windows and ceiling beams that create a light and airy feel. Fitted wardrobes along one wall offer ample storage space, while the room's focal point is a stone chimney breast with an original grate fire, adding a touch of character and charm.
The second bedroom, overlooking woodland views at the rear, is neutrally decorated, providing a blank canvas for your personal touch. Built-in wardrobes along one side offer convenient storage.
Adjacent to the bedroom is a contemporary shower room, complete with a vanity bowl sink set on an oak counter with storage underneath, a toilet, and a shower enclosure with a glazed screen. Cream tiling adds a touch of warmth and elegance to the space.
Step Outside
At the rear, a quaint, low-maintenance garden awaits, featuring an artificial lawn. Enclosed by sturdy dry-stone walls and complemented by tasteful timber fencing, this charming outdoor space offers both privacy and visual appeal.
Directly across the road from the house is Tootle Park, a large open field perfect for enjoying outdoor activities and walking the dog.
Out &amp; About
Harvey Street enjoys a fantastic location on the edge of rural countryside. Outdoor enthusiasts will love the proximity to Moss Bank Park, just a short walk away, while a scenic circular route along the West Pennine Way from Barrow Bridge through Smithills Woods offers another captivating option for nature lovers.
Everyday amenities are within easy reach, with a variety of bakeries, cafés, banks, shops, supermarkets, and post offices nearby. Major supermarkets like Morrisons and Asda are just a short drive away, ensuring convenience for your daily needs.
For dining out, local pubs off Halliwell Road, such as The Bob Smithy, are only a ten-minute drive away. Alternatively, enjoy a meal at Bake and Roast, located at the historic Smithills Hall, just a short stroll from the property.
Harvey Street is also well-connected to bus routes leading to Bolton and Horwich, offering easy public transportation options for residents.
Agent notes:
 Important Notice for Buyers
We do our best to make sure our property details are accurate and reliable, but they do not form part of any offer or contract and should not be relied upon as statements of fact. Measurements, photographs, floor plans, and any services or appliances listed are for guidance only — they may not be exact or tested. Some photographs may include virtually staged furnishings and décor intended to illustrate potential layouts or styling.
Fixtures &amp; Fittings
Any fixtures and fittings not specifically mentioned in the property details should be agreed separately with the seller.
Anti-Money Laundering (aml) &amp; Buyer id Checks
To comply with legal requirements, we must verify the identity of all buyers before we can move forward with a sale. We’ll also need proof of funds and details of your instructed solicitor at this stage. At Newton &amp; Co, we use a trusted third-party provider to complete these checks securely and quickly. There’s a small, non-refundable fee of £25 per person (or £50 if you’re buying through a company), which is paid directly to us when you’re ready to proceed. Please note, we can’t issue a memorandum of sale until these checks are complete — so the sooner they’re done, the sooner we can help you secure your new home.
Relationship Disclosure
In line with Section 21 of the Estate Agents Act 1979, we must declare if the owner of a property is related to anyone at Newton &amp; Co. If that’s ever the case, we’ll always let you know.
Referral Fees
We may recommend trusted partners for extra services you might need — such as conveyancing, mortgage advice, insurance, or surveys. Sometimes we receive a small referral fee for introducing you to these providers. You’re under no obligation to use them and you’re always welcome to choose your own.

Agent notes:
 Important Notice for Buyers
We do our best to make sure our property details are accurate and reliable, but they do not form part of any offer or contract and should not be relied upon as statements of fact. Measurements, photographs, floor plans, and any services or appliances listed are for guidance only — they may not be exact or tested. Some photographs may include virtually staged furnishings and décor intended to illustrate potential layouts or styling.
Fixtures &amp; Fittings
Any fixtures and fittings not specifically mentioned in the property details should be agreed separately with the seller.
Anti-Money Laundering (aml) &amp; Buyer id Checks
To comply with legal requirements, we must verify the identity of all buyers before we can move forward with a sale. We’ll also need proof of funds and details of your instructed solicitor at this stage. At Newton &amp; Co, we use a trusted third-party provider to complete these checks securely and quickly. There’s a small, non-refundable fee of £25 per person (or £50 if you’re buying through a company), which is paid directly to us when you’re ready to proceed. Please note, we can’t issue a memorandum of sale until these checks are complete — so the sooner they’re done, the sooner we can help you secure your new home.
Relationship Disclosure
In line with Section 21 of the Estate Agents Act 1979, we must declare if the owner of a property is related to anyone at Newton &amp; Co. If that’s ever the case, we’ll always let you know.

The current owners recently constructed a detached garage and store/workshop and laid a resin finished driveway to provide off road parking for up to five vehicles. The accommodation has combination gas fired central heating, upvc double glazing with (with working sash windows to the front) and the accommodation briefly comprises: Entrance porch, inner hall, lounge with woodburning stove, dining room, kitchen, rear lobby, guest cloakroom/w.c., conservatory, first floor landing, three double bedrooms (one with ensuite) and a main bathroom.

The property is constructed using locally sourced stone with a slate roof and was the original farmhouse on the site. A new farmhouse was subsequently built across the service lane, which still serves as the farmers' residence today.
The property has been systematically restored to exacting standards retaining the period features, most notable being the original mullioned windows and substantial beamed ceilings. Wood burning stoves have been installed together with hardwood sealed unit double glazing and more recently the cottage has been connected to mains water and mains electricity. There is combination central heating fired by lpg and septic tank drainage located well into the adjacent field.
The accommodation briefly comprises of entrance hall with guest cloakroom off, lounge with wood burner, beautiful farmhouse style kitchen again with wood burning stove, rear lobby with storage, first floor landing, three double sized bedrooms and a newly installed three piece shower room.

This extraordinary stone detached farmhouse, spanning over 4,000 square feet, seamlessly merges contemporary conveniences with the enchanting features of the Carolean era, creating a perfect blend of historical charm and modern luxury.
Nestled in the rural embrace of the West Pennine Moors in the picturesque village of Egerton, this unique five bedroom home offers breathtaking panoramic views that extend over Winter Hill, Belmont, and beyond, complemented by clear, open vistas of Dunscar Golf Course.
Imagine waking up to serene scenes of rolling hills, lush greenery, and the meticulously manicured fairways of the golf course, with the landscape changing its hues with the seasons. The sunsets here are nothing short of spectacular, painting the sky in a myriad of colours and providing a perfect backdrop for tranquil evenings.

Low dry stone walls and privet hedging border the neatly mown lawns adding the perfect external trimmings to this handsome and elegant home. Stroll through the manicured gardens, explore the natural beauty of the surrounding fields, or simply sit back and enjoy the serene ambiance.
The Warmest Of Welcomes
The stone-built entrance porch and oak door open into a welcoming hallway, marking the beginning of the enchantment that awaits within. To the right, a walk-in cloakroom and separate guest WC offer practical elegance. The study/snug, featuring an open fireplace, invites cosy evenings with a good book and serves as an ideal workspace for those who work from home.
Functional Splendour
Follow the glazed oak door from the hallway and step into the spectacular dining room. This space, capable of accommodating a grand 12-14 seater table, transforms into a billiards table after dinner, providing both elegance and versatility. The dining room features an open stone fireplace with a contemporary log burner, creating an ideal setting for intimate family dinners and grand feasts alike.

Elegance Unveiled
From the dining room, continue through into the impressive formal lounge. A conservatory-style corridor, flooded with natural light, guides you to this grand space, where high ceilings and an inviting atmosphere make it perfect for evening gatherings. The lounge is a masterpiece of design, with furniture thoughtfully centred around a contemporary inset wood burner stove, framed by a striking stone mosaic tiled chimney breast. This focal point exudes warmth and style, creating a cosy yet sophisticated ambiance. Light pours in through the triple aspect windows, which frame far-reaching views of the surrounding landscape, seamlessly inviting the outdoors in. The expansive windows not only enhance the room's airy feel but also offer a constantly changing canvas of the stunning countryside.
A glazed door leads directly from the lounge onto the patio area, creating an ideal flow for entertaining. Whether hosting a summer barbecue or an intimate evening under the stars, this seamless indoor-outdoor transition enhances the home's appeal and functionality. Here, you can fully appreciate the tranquillity and beauty of the estate, making every gathering a memorable experience.
Classic Meets Contemporary
Contemporary elegance merges with classic charm in the chicly-styled breakfast kitchen. Walnut and cream-colored units are artfully arranged around the room in a u-shape, offering abundant storage for all your kitchen essentials while complementing the rustic solid wood beams overhead. Taking centre stage is a generously-sized breakfast bar featuring a luxurious cream Corian worktop with an elegant glass shelf and seating for four, complete with a convenient wine cooler. The expansive worktops provide ample space for meal preparation, and two sinks strategically placed by the window offer pleasant garden views. A boiling water tap provides instant hot water, adding a touch of modern convenience to your daily routine. An integrated dishwasher further enhances functionality, making clean-up a breeze in this thoughtfully designed kitchen space. A sleek 5-ring induction hob and stainless steel extractor add to the modern appeal, providing efficient and stylish cooking capabilities.
On one side of the kitchen, tall units house an impressive array of high-end appliances, including three Neff ovens (including a steam oven), an inbuilt coffee machine, and flanking ‘Miele’ fridge and freezer units.
Two openings delineate the spacious breakfast dining room from the kitchen area. The travertine tiling seamlessly connects these spaces, enhanced by feature period panelling that includes a wall-mounted TV, creating an ideal focal point around which to centre your dining table.
Double doors open onto the rear garden and patio, creating a natural extension of the kitchen, perfect for outdoor dining and entertaining. This design allows light to flow beautifully into the dining area and seamlessly connects to the lounge next door, enhancing the sense of openness and connectivity throughout the home. From the patio, steps lead down to the spacious basement, providing easy access and establishing a continuous flow between the outdoor and indoor spaces. The basement, with its full head height and abundant storage, offers versatile use for storage, hobbies, or additional living space. This thoughtful layout integrates the garden, patio, kitchen, and lounge, creating a harmonious blend of indoor and outdoor living ideal for family life and entertaining.
Adjacent to the kitchen, a lobby provides access to the front garden and leads to a convenient and spacious larder/storage room located next to utility/ boot room.. The utility/boot room combines practicality and style, featuring wall and base cabinets topped with timber laminate worktops, a sink, and plumbing ready for a washer-dryer installation. This thoughtful design ensures both functionality and aesthetic harmony throughout the kitchen and utility areas. Tucked away in a corner of the home, a cosy sitting room offers a peaceful retreat.

The neutral walls and durable floor tiling, which matches the kitchen, provide versatility for a variety of uses within the room
Sweet Slumber
Ascend the stairs from the centrally located dining room to reach the spacious landing, where five exceptional bedrooms await. Each bedroom features professionally painted wardrobes in a Farrow &amp; Ball palette of soft hues, seamlessly blending with the overall aesthetic of the home, including the beautifully crafted doors throughout. Four of the bedrooms boast luxurious Villeroy &amp; Boch ensuite bathrooms, offering both elegance and comfort. This thoughtfully designed layout ensures that each space is not only functional but also harmoniously styled, creating a serene retreat for family and guests alike.
The main bedroom suite exudes charm with its high, sloping ceiling adorned with painted beams and triple aspect windows that frame picturesque countryside views. Ample space allows for a full set of furniture, complemented by a cosy seating area near the feature fireplace. A walk-in wardrobe adds practicality to the room, while light cream carpeting enhances its inviting ambiance.
Step through to the ensuite shower room, where a central double shower beckons, surrounded by textured tiled feature walls. A back-to-wall WC and contemporary wall-hung wash basin with a drawer below are set against an elegantly shelf tiled in glossy marble that matches the floor, adding a touch of sophistication to the space.
Adjacent to the main bedroom, along the hallway, bedroom four offers a sense of luxury and spaciousness, affording private views over the tranquil rear garden. The room is appointed with built-in wardrobes featuring elegantly painted panel sliding doors, seamlessly blending functionality with aesthetic appeal.
A short ascent from the bedroom leads to its ensuite bathroom, designed with meticulous attention to detail. Here, you'll find a WC and a wall-hung wash basin with a matching glossy timber shelf below, providing convenient storage. An illuminated mirror enhances the bathroom's ambiance while a built-in bath, complete with a shower above and a glazed screen, offers both comfort and style. A feature tiled strip complements the floor, adding a touch of sophistication to the overall design of this private retreat.
Also along this hallway, adorned in harmonious hues is bedroom three. Upon entering, you step into an open-plan dressing room that flows into the spacious bedroom. Built-in wardrobes match those of bedroom two. Triple aspect windows flood the room with natural light, while built-in shelving beside the chimney breast adds practical elegance to the space.
A glimpse into the ensuite bathroom reveals a long oak countertop with a bowl-style sink and wall-mounted taps, complemented by a shelf and an illuminated mirror above. The bathroom is further equipped with a back-to-wall WC and a double shower featuring a glazed screen. Modern touches include a ceiling-mounted rainfall shower head and sleek grey wall and floor tiling, creating a sophisticated and functional retreat.
On the opposite side of the landing, you'll find two of the five bedrooms, offering a private haven ideal for guests or family members visiting. This division is perfect for multi-generational living or providing teenagers with their own space.
Bedroom two is a generously-sized double room with two windows overlooking the front garden. It boasts ample space for a full set of furniture, adorned in neutral décor to suit any taste. The ensuite shower room features a back-to-wall WC, a double shower with a glazed screen, and a countertop with a bowl sink. An illuminated mirror adds to the functionality of the space, while neutral tiling with textured accents in the shower area enhances its aesthetic appeal.
Bedroom five looks out over the front and is currently set up as a nursery. It boasts neutral décor and features an ornamental period fireplace, adding character and charm to the room.
Slice of Paradise
The spacious t-shape layout of the property allows for distinct areas and private pockets of beautifully landscaped formal gardens, ensuring rest, relaxation, and sunshine throughout the day.
Outside the front, cobbled patios extend from the lounge and conservatory, while a gravelled area leads to the front entrance.
To the rear, a spacious patio seamlessly transitions from stone paving to timber decking. Enclosed by a dry stone wall, this area is perfect for entertaining, enjoying the sunshine, gathering around a firepit, and witnessing spectacular sunsets over Winter Hill and beyond. A short walk from the patio leads to a large, lush lawn bordered by mature plantings, which enhance privacy and neatly delineate the area from the surrounding fields. Currently, sheep graze peacefully in these 20 acres of fields, adding to the pastoral charm of the setting

Are you in search of a charming &amp; characterful 3-bedroom cottage in Sharples?
Tucked away, just off Andrew Lane, in the sought-after area of Sharples, Old Eagley Mews is a charming stone mews property blending historic character with modern convenience.
Dating back approximately 270 years, this unique home is part of a conversion completed in 1984, offering a rare opportunity to own a piece of local history.

Welcome Home
Step inside, and the charm continues with a sitting room that features a beamed ceiling, mullioned windows, and original-style timber doors with traditional latches. This cosy space, perfect as a sitting room or even a study, immediately sets the tone for the rest of the home.
From here, move through to the living room, which mirrors the same rustic décor with exposed beams. The focal point is an original stone fireplace with a black grate, around which the furniture is thoughtfully arranged. A window looks out onto the front garden, and there is an additional door providing another access point to the front. A staircase leads up to the first floor, adding to the natural flow of the ground floor layout.
Next, flow into the kitchen, which is fitted with timber wall and base units, a contrasting worktop, and an integrated oven with a 4-ring gas hob.

Having been in the same family since 1992, the property has been meticulously maintained, with some areas updated over the years.

Serenity and Sophistication in the Pennines
Nestled in the heart of Lancashire's captivating countryside, The White House at Longshaw Head epitomises the seamless blend of rustic charm and contemporary elegance. Surrounded by the rolling hills of the Pennines, this picturesque property boasts unmatched views across Winter Hill, Darwen Tower, Manchester City Centre, and beyond.
Accessed via a tranquil farmer's lane off Crowthorn Road, complete with grazing animals and cattle grids, The White House has undergone a meticulous transformation from a traditional farmhouse to a luxurious sophisticated sanctuary. Its crisp, pristine white exterior is adorned with expansive glass windows that frame the breath-taking landscape. Preserving its timber beams and original features pays homage to the farmhouse's rich history while seamlessly incorporating modern comforts.
Welcome Home
As you step inside the hallway, marvel at the modern minimalism of this utterly unique home. Triangular glazed windows above and extensive glazing on either side of the door create a stunning entrance that bathes the space in natural light.
Rich laminate flooring underfoot radiates warmth and charm, providing a beautiful contrast to the crisp white walls. The neutral interior design effortlessly combines rustic elements with sleek, modern finishes, creating an atmosphere that is both stylish and comfortable.
Light Filled Living
The spacious open-plan living area is a testament to contemporary design, bathed in natural light that highlights the high ceilings and exposed, wooden-clad beams. This airy expanse feels both grand and inviting, offering a seamless flow that encourages both relaxation and entertainment. A striking brick and timber feature fireplace, complete with a wood burner stove and a wall-mounted TV point above, anchors the room.
A Sociable Hub
Large bi-folding doors with windows above fit into the original barn opening, seamlessly connecting the indoors to the breath-taking outdoors. These doors open out onto the patio, providing a perfect spot to watch the sunset from both inside and outside the home.
A state-of-the-art show kitchen showcases a stunning central island unit with breakfast bar seating, featuring a contrasting marble effect finish. This design makes it an ideal sociable hub for both intimate family gatherings and grand entertaining. The luxuriously appointed kitchen is equipped with sleek white cupboards and drawers, providing ample storage for all your culinary essentials.
Cook up a feast for family and friends using the array of high-end appliances, including a halogen hob within the island, a fridge, freezer, dishwasher, and two built-in ovens flanking the sink and drainer with Quooker boiling water tap, which look out over the rear patio area. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or enjoying a quiet evening in, this space is designed to accommodate every facet of modern living with elegance and grace.
A sliding timber door opens to unveil a separate prep kitchen, strategically designed to maintain the main kitchen's cleanliness during entertaining and meal preparation. This secondary space boasts pristine white base units paired with a durable laminate worktop, offering ample workspace for culinary tasks. It features an integrated electric oven and convenient halogen hob for versatile cooking, alongside a gleaming stainless steel sink for easy clean-up. In addition to its culinary role, the prep kitchen functions as a practical utility area with laundry facilities, including plumbing for a washer and dryer. Ample cabinetry ensures all kitchen essentials are neatly stored, creating a clutter-free environment ideal for hosting guests.
Adjacent to the prep kitchen, discover a convenient downstairs cloakroom with a WC and wash hand basin. A door from here provides direct access to the side elevation and driveway.
Mezzanine glass balconies on each side of the vaulted ceiling enhance the sense of openness and transparency.
One staircase leads to a carpeted and inviting sitting area or home office space, providing a cosy space for reading or relaxation while overlooking the expansive lounge, kitchen, and dining area below. With a bit of remodelling, this space could also serve as a fourth bedroom if needed.
And So To Bed...
On the opposite side, a second staircase ascends to a mezzanine landing that leads to the main bedroom suite. This expansive bedroom is thoughtfully designed with a freestanding bath strategically positioned to capture breath-taking sunset views from one window and sunrise vistas from another. Adjacent to the bedroom is a spacious walk-in wardrobe for ample storage.
A door opens into a light-filled ensuite shower room featuring a contemporary vanity unit, a back-to-wall hung WC, and a large walk-in shower enclosed by a glazed screen. The room is adorned with travertine-coloured tiling on both floor and walls, lending a luxurious feel. A Velux window overhead fills the space with natural light. A cleverly concealed door behind a mirror leads to additional eaves storage, maximizing functionality without compromising on style.
Below the main bedroom, on the ground floor, you'll find two additional ensuite double bedrooms. Each room is adorned with neutral décor and boasts picture windows offering stunning views of the open countryside. Laminate flooring provides a warm contrast, complementing the space for double beds and full furniture sets.
Both ensuite bathrooms are well-appointed with double showers enclosed by glazed screens and feature WC facilities. One bathroom includes a pedestal sink beneath a window, while the other boasts a vanity bowl sink with a storage cabinet below and a fitted mirror above. Both bathrooms showcase elegant grey tiling in two distinct textures, enhancing their modern appeal.
The corridor leading to these bedrooms is fitted with built-in storage wardrobes, ideal for organising personal belongings. A door at the end of the corridor opens onto the rear patio space, offering convenient access to outdoor relaxation areas.
Garden Escapes
Step outside and prepare to be captivated by breath-taking views of the surrounding countryside and farmland, extending as far as the eye can see. The picturesque front patio beckons, offering an idyllic setting for relaxation and outdoor entertainment while soaking in the panoramic vistas mentioned earlier.
While most time is spent enjoying the front patio for its stunning views, an additional patio area at the rear of the home provides another charming space. Stone driveway parking is available on both sides of the home, accommodating several vehicles comfortably.
Across the driveway, a section of grassland presents additional opportunities. Should you desire additional land in front for purposes such as grazing animals, the current owner is open to offers, adding flexibility and potential to this already captivating property.
On Your Doorstep
Embrace the easy pleasures of rural living, with walks in abundance on the doorstep. Head out over the hills behind the home towards Holcombe, or pay a visit to the local Wayoh and Entwistle Reservoirs a short distance walk away.
Treat the children at the famous Holdens Ice Cream Shop in Edgworth, where you will also find handy essentials such as a Post Office, hairdresser, two cafes and chemist alongside a cricket club and bowling green.
Enjoy a drink in one of the local pubs, such as The Rose and Crown, or choose from a wider array of pubs and bars in nearby Ramsbottom. For entertainment and evenings out, family-friendly Giuseppe’s or The Toby both serve a mixture of Italian and Mediterranean cuisine - famed for their atmosphere and friendly welcome.
Children are well catered for with local schools in both Turton and Edgworth. Nearby secondary schools include Turton School and Canon Slade – only a ten-minute bus ride away.
Commuters can connect with ease via the M65, M66 and M62, just a short drive away, with Bury, Bolton, Manchester and Blackburn all easily accessible.

A Warm Welcome
Welcome to this truly exceptional five-bedroom detached family residence, gracefully positioned on an enviable corner plot at the corner of New Tempest Road and Tempest Road in Lostock. With uninterrupted fields framing the front and rear, this home offers a peaceful retreat from the world, surrounded by the rolling views of Winter Hill and Rivington Pike.
As you arrive, park effortlessly on the spacious driveway that accommodates several cars, or glide into the double integral garage, where an electric car charging point awaits. The charming yet discreet canopy entrance draws you in, setting the tone for the warmth and sophistication found within.
Spacious Living
Step through the front door and into the impressive reception hallway, where a beautiful glazed staircase catches the light, hinting at the elegant finishes that await throughout. To the left, the practical utility room links to the garage—ideal for family life—while the heart of the home opens up just beyond.
Here, a grand open-plan living space unfolds, seamlessly uniting the kitchen, dining, and sitting areas to create a haven for gatherings both large and small. Awash with natural light from wide, glazed windows and a vaulted ceiling adorned with Velux windows, this ‘Morning Room’ exudes an airy brightness, perfect for all occasions.
Culinary Delights
The kitchen is truly the heart of this home, designed for both the avid chef and casual cook. Classic white shaker cabinets are topped with gleaming black granite, creating an elegant, timeless look that balances beauty with durability. A breakfast bar comfortably seats four, inviting family or friends to gather for morning coffees or casual meals, while kids can use it for homework as you cook. Equipped with a 5-ring gas hob, built-in oven, grill, and stainless steel extractor, the kitchen is ready for any culinary challenge, from everyday dinners to lavish feasts.
Practicality is woven into the layout, with plumbing for a dishwasher and an inset stainless steel sink positioned by the rear window, allowing for garden views as you prep and wash. The kitchen flows seamlessly into the connecting sitting-dining area, with UPVC French doors leading out to the expansive patio. This open-plan design allows for effortless indoor-outdoor entertaining, so whether you’re hosting friends, preparing family dinners, or enjoying a quiet breakfast, this space is as functional as it is inviting.
Tranquil Flow
The oak flooring extends from the kitchen into the adjacent lounge, where timber French doors invite you into a peaceful retreat. Both sliding and French doors bring the outdoors in, offering a seamless flow from one entertaining space to another.
Family Flow
For cosier evenings, retreat to the family sitting room, an intimate space painted in a deep, comforting blue to one side, ideal for movie nights, with French shutters and a gas inset fire creating an ambiance of warmth.
Further enhancing the versatility of this home is a formal dining room, ideal for celebratory meals.
Guest Comfort
Adjacent, a charming guest bedroom with an ensuite offers privacy and comfort for visiting friends or family. Next to it, a convenient downstairs WC adds extra practicality.
Bedtime Beckons
As evening falls, ascend the stylish glazed staircase to the first-floor galleried landing—a tranquil spot to unwind with a book or simply enjoy the view.
Room For All
The main bedroom is a showstopper, luxuriously spacious with fitted furniture and a dedicated dressing area. French doors open onto a private balcony, where you can sip your morning coffee as you soak in the views of the countryside. The ensuite is equally indulgent, featuring a wc, wall hung wash basin, a bath, a corner shower, and sophisticated mosaic tiling.
On the opposite side, Bedroom Two offers built-in wardrobes, plenty of space for seating, and room for a dressing table, all while enjoying scenic views over the fields from the front of the house. The ensuite is a luxurious space, featuring a p-shaped bath with a shower overhead, a sleek glazed screen, a WC, and a vanity sink unit with white cupboards and a black countertop, adding both functionality and style.
Bedroom Three is another spacious retreat, with built-in wardrobes and enough room for a cosy sitting area. Its own ensuite includes a corner shower, WC, and a pedestal sink, creating a private and comfortable space.
At the far end of the home, Bedroom Five is currently used as a study, offering a quiet and serene workspace with beautiful views of Winter Hill. Adjacent to this room is a generous storage area that could easily be transformed into a dressing room or an additional ensuite, providing flexibility to suit your needs.
Outdoor Living
Outside, the rear garden serves as a private sanctuary, with an expansive Indian stone patio that wraps around the home. This generous outdoor space offers multiple seating areas, creating the perfect backdrop for al fresco dining, summer barbecues, or simply unwinding in the tranquility of nature. The lush, green lawn at both the front and rear adds a sense of serenity, bordered by tall hedgerows at the rear and sturdy walls and fencing on the sides, ensuring both privacy and a sense of openness.
Every corner of this home embodies a lifestyle that seamlessly blends elegance with comfort, enhanced by modern amenities like solar roof panels and energy storage batteries that make sustainable living effortless. Here, modern innovation meets timeless charm, creating a space that is both stylish and energy-efficient. It’s more than just a house; it’s an invitation to embrace a life of refined ease, enduring beauty, and forward-thinking sustainability.

Notes from the planning consultant;
dryfield cottage, rivington
The plans that have been produced suggest a possible range of extensions to the existing cottage. These include single storey side and rear extensions aimed at providing proportionate additions to significantly enhance the overall floorspace of the dwelling.
The site of Dryfield Cottage is located within the designated Green Belt, where development is very much restricted. As a consequence, the use of ‘permitted development’ (pd) does offer the potential for extensions and the like that otherwise may not be granted planning permission. These provisions (pd) have been influential with regard the plans which have been prepared.
Consequently, the extensions are aimed at benefitting from ‘permitted development’ i.e. Elements of these proposals are unlikely to require planning permission. If the development was proposed, as suggested, or variations of such a development, then further discussion would be required as regards the position in respect planning legislation. It would be recommended that a ‘Certificate of Lawfulness’ or ‘Prior Approval’ from Chorley Council should be persued. Further advice can be given in this respect.
The extensions, as proposed, are architect designed and seek to sympathetically extend the initial cottage in a contemporary way. The design has specific regard to the relative scale which would result between the existing and proposed, roof profiles, the proportion of the window openings and use of facing materials. The outbuilding proposes ancillary residential provision, including an ensuite bedroom, day/hobbies room and small gym. Alternative residential uses, which would be incidental to the main use of the site for the existing dwelling may well be acceptable. The site plan also includes off street parking.
The proposals seek to take full advantage of the site and existing dwelling including maximising views across the site and to the wider landscape, sunlight, and daylight into rooms and maintaining privacy.
Further information is available regarding the potential for development on the site can be provided.
Agents description
A fantastic and rare opportunity to purchase a detached home which is situated within a generous plot of around 0.224 of an acre and located in a very high calibre semi rural location with open fields to the side and rear plus a superb view of Rivington Pike and the surrounding hills.
The property would no doubt suit those downsizing from a large home but wishing to retain large gardens and a high quality location. There is also great potential to work with the existing structure and gain planning permission to extend and thus create a house tailored to a buyers own style and specification. Equally, a buyer my consider wholesale redevelopment of the plot where the location can support selling figures in excess of £1M.
The current layout includes a lounge and breakfast kitchen to the ground floor and two bedrooms plus bathroom and separate shower room to the first floor. Either the shower room or bathroom could easily be sacrificed to create an additional bedroom.
We are advised that the property is Freehold and council tax band E

Dryfield Lane is a highly regarded road in Rivington which is a village just on the outskirts of Horwich. The location blends a rural setting seamlessly with excellent access to facilities and an excellent transport links. The popular and independent Bolton School is around 5 miles away and Dryfield Lane is close to their bus route. Horwich town centre, which includes a good collection of largely independently owned shops and services is under one mile away whilst larger retail outlets can be found towards the Middlebrook development close to the football stadium which includes associated transport links (Horwich Parkway train station on the mainline to Manchester plus junction 6 of the M61).
Blackrod train station is physically the closest rail link, is on the main line to Manchester and is around 1.5 miles away whilst the motorway junction is around 3 miles aware. Those busy working in Manchester city centre, for example, would no doubt relish their journey home to a rural retreat to enjoy the country park setting and enviable views. The area is synonymous with the philanthropist Lord Leverhulme who is understood to have socialised with the owners of properties in the area. To enjoy a slice of the towns heritage along with an individual residence and proportionate garden then look no further. This could well be the home for you.

"An impressive, rural Hamlet style setting
Accommodation of around 3700 sqft
Great outdoor space approaching 1 acre
Stunning far-reaching views
Excellent provision for storage
Huge master bedroom with vaulted ceiling
Around 3.5 miles to train link
Under 5 miles to M61
Substantial driveway, plus garage and outbuilding
Fantastic, large cottage kitchen
The Home:
A large, detached stone dwelling nestled within the West Pennine Moors on the Smithills Estate and enjoying fantastic far-reaching views.
Bumblebee Cottage is one of just four properties within the Hampsons Farm development which is a former working farm now converted to a residential, hamlet style setting. Being the only detached unit adds an additional level of prestige and the commanding plot adjoins open fields.
The home was only constructed around 10 to 15 years ago, and therefore combines the rural setting and farm characteristics of stone walls under a slated roof with the benefits of modern construction methods and insulation qualities.
The room proportions speak for themselves and there has been a great provision for storage within both the double garage and additional outbuilding. A large driveway caters for a mass of vehicles and also allows for the private storage of motorhomes/caravans etc….
The sellers inform us that the property is Leaseholrd for a term of 999 years from 17.04.2003.
Council Tax Band G - £3,568.48
The loft space is for the full footprint and has a ladder
The Area:
Dwellings of this style are often seen as a 'forever home' type and are seldom placed into the open market and therefore this can be seen as a rare opportunity to acquire such a property. As our clients have mentioned, the location strikes a superb balance of rural surroundings, yet handy transport links and we feel this characteristic will become increasingly important as the inner city and inner town locations become more densely populated.
Junction 5 of the M61 is approx 5 miles away and Lostock train station which is on the mainline to Manchester is approx. 3.5 miles away. The area in which the property is situated has recently been purchased by The Woodland Trust who are heavily investing with the restoration and ongoing care of the moors and woodland. We feel this will only enhance what has long been regarded as a high calibre rural retreat.
Many people who live in the vicinity consider Manchester and the Trafford Centre an appropriate distance to work, shop and socialise. Closer, there are a great variety of shops and services within Horwich town centre itself and the Middlebrook retail development.

Historically speaking 54 Church Street was built between 1803 and 1809 by the workers at the ‘Wallsuches Bleach Works’, from the proceeds of a Terminating Building Society, hence the properties are known as Club Houses. Originally No.2 Chapel Street was a bakehouse. The cellar of No.54 was used for cotton handloom weaving and had external access up into Chapel Street. No.54 is the only three-storey house in the area: The attic would have been used as a warehouse for raw materials and finished goods. There once was an interconnecting door from the back bedroom into No.56 and all along the terrace.
At the end of the 19th century, No.54 was a pub, the Three Horseshoes. During the early 20th century, the Horwich Town Band practised in the attic; access to the attic was via a fixed ladder and trapdoor from the back bedroom and there was still a partitioned servants’ bedroom in the sw corner with gas lighting.
Previous owners converted the 2 houses from flats back into a single dwelling.
Since 1988 the house has provided a ground-floor 'Granny Flat’ and accommodation above for a family of five.

The Area:
Located opposite the Parish Church, Church Street is regarded as a high calibre part of the town. A key strength to homes within this area is their ability to provide access into the countryside which is possible to access just past the church. Footpaths lead into the hills that provide an impressive backdrop to the town.
Whilst these rural links are so close to hand, the town also functions brilliantly as a commuter belt towards Manchester benefiting from access to several train stations linking to the city, together with junctions 5 and 6 of the M61. The commercial centre itself includes a pleasant range of mainly independently owned shops and services and within around half a mile of the subject property there is childcare at nursery level whilst the town has several primary and secondary schools.
The nearby Chorley Old Road is a bus route linking Bolton to Chorley and commercial amenities are enhanced by the Middlebrook retail development which is close to the previously mentioned junction 5 motorway link. The retail park is around 1.5 miles away and includes a wealth of large outlets together with restaurants, cinema, gym etc. All in all, we feel that the area offers a family-friendly package.

The Home
A very popular design of four bedroom and two reception room detached located within a quiet quiet cul-de-sac just off St Leonards Avenue.
The home has retained its original configuration and it is worthy of note that many other homes of this design have been extended by building to the side of the kitchen and rear of the garage.
There is a generous entrance hallway and sizable landing, which enjoys natural light. The substantial lounge runs parallel with the kitchen to the rear and offers great potential to create open plan living should this be desired. The very fact that the property is situated within a cul-de-sac is a characteristic which should not be underestimated.
We have been advised by our vendor that the property is Freehold. Council Tax Band E.
The Area:
Blandford Rise is a cul- de- sac just off St Leonards Avenue and Purbeck Drive. The development is close to the Beehive roundabout in Lostock and is a well-regarded area. Many people would look to purchase due to the outstanding travel connections which include Horwich Parkway train station and junction 6 of the M61 which are approximately 1.5 miles away. There is popular local schooling with both primary and secondary schools serving the area. From a commercial point of view there is a large out of town style retail development close to the aforementioned train station; whilst Horwich town centre itself is a traditional retail centre with many independently- owned shops and services and is around 2 miles away. A simple glimpse at a satellite image of the area will show abundant open green space and so the area is ideal for those who enjoy spending time outdoors.

The Home:
Viewings strictly by appointment only.
Our clients have owned this home for in excess of 40 years and chose to settle for such a length of time due to the excellent and convenient location together with the enviable matured landscaped garden to the front, rear and side.
It is this plot size that offers great scope for an onward purchaser to extend and develop the dwelling which is a consistent theme within the surrounding area.
The current accommodation includes 4 bedrooms spread over four, split level floors and our clients have taken care to maintain the property well during their lengthy ownership and have installed 4 external CCTV cameras which are wi-fi linked. The doors and windows also have a security system and ir detection.
The subject property has been a well-loved family home for a significant period of time and may well be ideal in its current form for its next owner. Equally the potential to extend is undoubted and will no doubt broaden the market significantly.
The sellers inform us that the property is Freehold.
Council Tax Band G - £3628.51
The Area:
Viewings strictly by appointment only.
Ashridge Close is a cul-de-sac located close to Lostock train station and would therefore appeal to people who require this commuting facility; our clients have commented on how useful this has been over the years and by the time many other commuters are still getting in their car to continue their journey home, our client has put the key in the front door and is starting to 'settle in' for the evening.
There is a combination of secondary and primary schools which serve the general area and it is also note-worthy that the popular, private Bolton School attracts many people to settle within the area. In terms of commercial opportunities, Horwich centre is just over three miles away and the Middlebrook Retail Complex approximately two miles away. They offer a vast array of shops and services. With those not familiar with the Ashridge Close address, the property is roughly between Regent Road and Lostock Junction Lane.

The Home
Benefiting from immaculate presentation and many upgrades during recent years. In the last 12 months there has been a replacement kitchen, bathroom and floor coverings and it is worthy of note that homes are seldom placed into the open market within this cul-de-sac. The layout includes an individual hallway with ground floor WC lounge through dining room and a superb modern kitchen.
The three bedrooms to the first floor are a good size and served by a most impressive family bathroom. Given the scarcity of available homes within the immediate area, we would certainly recommend an early viewing.

Situated within a prime residential area of Bolton, the five-bedroom No. 3 Rosebank was built in 1976, since when it has been considerably enlarged by the present owners during their 36 years occupancy.
Rosebank is a tree-lined cul-de-sac of nine well-spaced properties. The South-facing No. 3 occupies a generous plot with mature well-tended gardens, of which that at the rear enjoys good privacy. The driveway at the front has parking for three/four cars, giving access to the integral double garage with its remote-controlled door.
Heating throughout the house is provided by radiators, served by a gas-fired modern Viessmann condensing boiler installed new in May 2021. The main lounge also has a gas fire whilst there is a log burner installed in the living/reception room at the rear of the house.
The front and rear extensions to the house were completed in 1996, providing the second living room at the rear, and - in addition to the already existing dining kitchen - a separate dining room accessed from the front entrance hallway. At the rear, a washroom/toilet and a storage room were also added.
The plot on which 3 Rosebank is situated has ground space sufficient for further opportunities for enlargement and development, in addition to possibilities for upper floor enlargement, all subject to planning permission.
Rosebank is 0.3 miles from the ‘outstanding’ rated Lostock primary school. It is well placed for easy access to the M61, and to Lostock mainline station with its links to Manchester, Preston and beyond. The private and highly regarded Bolton School and Clevelands school are within two miles distant. Middlebrook retail centre is within a two-mile radius.
This region of Bolton is an exceptionally ‘green’ and pleasant area. There are two golf courses within a radius of one mile, and four courses within two miles.

Large design
2 storage cupboards within the apartment plus additional storage available
Pleasant private aspect from the primary rooms
Substantial lead reception room
Allocated parking for two vehicles
Gated complex just off Chorley New Road
Constructed during 2007
Ideal for those downsizing from a larger dwelling
Great access to the variety of amenities in Heaton
One of the larger designs of apartment at 1146sqft which when compared with other units at the nearby Clevelands development whose measurements are around 830sqft really stands out from the crowd.
Each of the primary rooms enjoy a private aspect and the dimensions throughout were a very pleasant surprise to our company during the first visit. The previous owners downsized from a large dwelling but did not wish to compromise on the size of the rooms with which they were accustomed. At the time of purchase there was simply a desire to have less rooms and ease of maintenance.
In addition to the original fitted storage, the master bedroom is well planned to include a host of fitted furniture and there is the option of renting a secure compound within the vaults of the building. The lead reception room is 24’9 x 14’9 and both bedrooms are an excellent double size.
The home has been maintained to an excellent standard and please note that there is no onward chain.
The property is Leasehold for a term of 125 years from 1st January 2006 subject to the payment of a yearly Ground Rent of £270
Council Tax is Band E - £2,616.88
Greenmount Close is part of a relatively new development just off Chorley New Road in Heaton and therefore has excellent access along one of the town's main roads. The immediate area is generally surrounded by quality, high value properties and has good access towards Bolton and Horwich town centres plus the 'out of town' Middlebrook retail development and near to Bolton School. Heaton includes some sports clubs, wine bars and restaurants with good access also available towards Lostock and its variety of golf clubs.

Stunning 5-Bed Detached Home In Entwistle With Stunning Views Of Both Wayoh &amp; Entwistle Reservoir
Rural, but not remote, escape the hustle and bustle at The Marl, a home where traditional design and communal open plan living combine. Overlooking the reservoirs of Entwistle and Wayoh, and just moments’ walk from the train station, The Marl is a countryside oasis with connections to the wider world.
Rural But Not Remote
Nestled between the reservoirs of Entwistle and Wayoh and surrounded by fields and countryside, discover The Marl, a lovingly designed home bursting with warmth and character, tucked away at the end of Overshores Road, Turton.
A private lane delivers you into the heart of the landscape, and to the gravel driveway of this rural haven, where estate fencing preserves the uninterrupted views of garden and countryside beyond.
Once home to an 1800s cottage, The Marl, a handsome home designed to maximise the stunning views out over the fields and reservoirs, stands on this same plot, built in 2011 to offer a balance of traditional living for a modern era.
Ample parking is available on the driveway, before making your way indoors, via the oak portico entrance and traditional-style front door.
Traditional Home, For Modern Living
Light streams into the broad and bright entrance hallway, through windows to either side of the front door. Underfoot, marble tiles gleam, amplifying the sense of light and space. Connecting to all the downstairs rooms, the entrance hall is a destination in itself, and also offers access to an understairs storage area.
On hand for guests, a beautifully finished shower room can be found ahead from the front door, tiled in marble and furnished with walk-in shower, wall mounted wash basin and WC.
Carpeted in cream, a traditional parlour style sitting room awaits on the right, awash with light courtesy of large windows to either side of the imposing stone fireplace, within which an impactful Chesney’s log-burning stove fills the room with warmth and welcome.
Light-filled Living
French doors invite further light in, opening to provide instant access out to the garden. A highlight of The Marl, you needn’t leave the comfort of your seat to soak up the stunning views out over the fields and water.
Double doors open up to the left of the entrance hall, where formal feasting can be enjoyed in the traditional dining room, a spacious room with a peaceful ambience, overlooking the drive via a bay window. Warmth emanates from the corner fireplace, furnished with a Stovax log burner.
Also opening up on the left from the entrance hall is a second family sitting room, with a cosy corner stone fireplace housing an inset log burner, filling the room with cosy warmth. Marble tiling flows underfoot, making this the perfect family room, practical too for pets.
With four, fantastically sized reception rooms available at The Marl, there is great flexibility to redefine the rooms to suit your own needs, substituting sitting or dining room for play room, cinema room or snug.
Feast Your Eyes
Ahead from the entrance hall and to the right, feast your eyes on the impressive Stuart Fraser Siematic kitchen. A host of integrated appliances include four Neff ovens (microwave, steam and two conventional), Neff dishwasher, Samsung American-style fridge-freezer and an induction hob within the central island breakfast bar, which also features an undermounted sink with Quooker instant boiling tap.
Cleverly designed to wrap around the kitchen, the dining and lounge areas of this sociable and open plan family kitchen flow off from the central island, which also features breakfast bar seating, retaining a connection between the chef and the rest of the household.
Family Time
Overflowing with light and with incredible views out over the countryside, reservoirs and distant hills, big bifolding doors to three sides retain that constant connection to the outdoors. Accessed from both the kitchen and main sitting room, step out beneath the shelter of the covered patio and savour the views whilst dining alfresco.
Marble flooring is practical and elegant underfoot, whilst the inset log-burning stove, with built-in log storage beneath, infuses the room with heat from the lounge area. The ultimate entertaining space, speakers connect to the Bose surround sound (connections are also available in the master bedroom and dining room) making this the perfect party room on special occasions.
Owner quote: “I wanted the indoors to connect with the outdoors; you don’t need to stand at the window to feel you are in the countryside.”
Tucked off the kitchen, discover the handy utility, with further storage and plumbing for washer and dryer. There is direct access out to the garden from the utility room.
Bedtime Beckons
Ascend the carpeted stairs, with oak handrail, to the first-floor landing, a large, light-flooded space with access out to a glass fronted balcony, providing sunset vistas out over the Wayoh reservoir .
On the left, make your way to bedroom three, the first of five, spacious, king-size bedrooms. Warm tones dress the walls in this welcoming room, with ample space for wardrobes and fantastic views down over the Entwistle reservoir. Guests can freshen up in their own private ensuite, where a band of glossy red tiling continues the warm motif from the bedroom. Furnished with a large, walk-in shower, with waterfall head and handheld attachment, there is also a wash basin and WC.
Dressed in peaceful duck egg tones, bedroom four is infused with light from a large window looking out over the fields and valley towards Edgworth. Peaceful and serene, with ample space for wardrobes, wake up to glorious sunrises.
Soak and Sleep
Rejuvenate your senses in the large family bathroom, where a freestanding Whirlpool jacuzzi bath, with retractable showerhead attachment, invites you to soak away your aches and relax. Warm your towel on the chrome heated towel radiator and spritz your way into a new day beneath the rainfall spray of the separate walk-in shower, also featuring handheld showerhead attachment. There is also a wash basin and WC.
Sneak a peek at bedroom five, with space for a double bed, this versatile bedroom, currently serving as a study, could be used as a nursery, with verdant views across the valley to the south.
Sumptuously sized, bedroom two is dressed in a feature wall of forest green and has ample space for a king size bed alongside freestanding wardrobes and drawers. Relaxation awaits in the ensuite, served by corner shower unit, WC, wash basin and bath.
Sanctuary awaits in the master suite, a celebration of space, sunlight and serenity. Windows and French doors invite light in from two aspects, framing views out over both the Entwistle and Wayoh reservoirs, and opening to a balcony.
Overhead, the high ceiling, with lights recessed within the plasterwork, adds a reverent feel, spacious and airy, whilst cleverly positioned half walls lend structure to the space, creating a dressing room area and providing the perfect place for the king-size bed.
Wake up to views out over the valley to the Wayoh reservoir ahead, whilst to the right, look down through a window onto the Entwistle reservoir.
Freshen up in the private ensuite, with its own sauna, double jacuzzi bath, wash basin, separate shower and WC.
Cocooned in Countryside
Outside, the low maintenance lawns and Indian stone paved patios blend seamlessly with the surrounding countryside, separated by estate fencing, providing privacy whilst retaining the unbroken vistas that define life at The Marl.
Perfect for entertaining, safe and secure for children, this is a home in constant connection with the outdoors.
Owner quote: “It’s very private, you feel when you’re looking out as though you are master of all you survey – the views are endless.”
Along the gable side of the home runs a slated canopy, providing shelter and shade from the sun and retaining year-round use of the garden come rain or shine. Enjoy a glass of wine, a gin and tonic, or a lemonade whilst watching the sun travel around the home before setting at the front over the Entwistle reservoir.
Near and Far
Step out of the front door and discover the tracks and trails that take you into the heart of the countryside.
Rural, yet not remote, you can lock the front door and wheel your suitcase just a few minutes along the lane and catch a train to Manchester Airport within the hour, before travelling on to any destination.
Stroll the shores of nearby reservoirs of Turton, Entwistle and Wayoh, explore the local woodland and treat yourself to tasty refreshment at Holdens Ice Cream Parlour after first quenching your thirst at The Strawbury Duck.
Explore the friendly village of Edgworth, where amenities include a local butchers, hairdressers and beauticians. You can pick up your essentials at the local newsagents and pick up a sandwich and coffee at the café. There is also a Post Office.
A spacious home, perfect for families, those with children can choose from a range of nearby schools including Edgworth Primary School and Turton Secondary
School, with the renowned independent Bolton School also within commuter reach.
Edgworth itself is a lively community, with events held regularly at the Barlow Institute and village hall. Alongside a number of pubs there is also a popular cricket club.
An easily maintained home built to a distinguishably high standard, The Marl is a versatile home with so much to offer. With ample bedrooms and reception rooms for a young family, it would also suit those downsizing and in search of seclusion and solitude whilst still feeling connected.
Owner quote: “There’s a sense of inner peace I always have when i’m here.”
A home that wraps itself around you, embrace the elements and discover the peace and tranquility of The Marl, a traditional home delivering modern living, that encourages you to slow down and be present in the moment. Leave the wider world behind (it’s only a train ride away) and embrace the now, at The Marl.

Furthermore, Solicitors should confirm movable items described in the sales particulars and, in fact, included in the sale since circumstances do change during the marketing or negotiations. Although we try to ensure accuracy, if measurements are used in this listing, they may be approximate.

We are required by law to conduct anti-money laundering checks on all those buying a property.

The cost of these checks is £65 (incl. VAT), which covers the cost of obtaining relevant data and any manual checks and monitoring which might be required. This fee will need to be paid by you in advance of us issuing a memorandum of sale, directly to Lifetime Legal, and is non-refundable. We will receive some of the fee taken by Lifetime Legal to compensate for its role in the provision of these checks.

"Large plot just over 0.5 of an acre
Private road hosting just 10 dwellings
Golf course to the front
Manchester commuter belt with mainline train station around 1 mile by road
Connection to M61 around 2 miles
Bolton School just over 2 miles
Planning granted for the construction of a 10,000 square-foot home
High calibre location
Mains services connected to site and freehold
Large retail development conveniently positioned around 1.5 miles away
Understood to be constructed around 1940 and owned within the same family for over 50 years.
The plot is just over half an acre, and it is generally a level site and is of a regular shape. Many years ago, the family purchased an additional strip of land and so there is a greater width when compared to some similar homes within the vicinity. Main services are connected, and our clients have also acquired the freehold.
The current dwelling is a four bedroom detached which in itself is a pleasant size but equally modest when compared to some of the more recently constructed properties along the road. As such, we are happy to report that our clients have gained detailed planning to construct a ‘super home’ of 10,000 ft.².
As such, the lengthy and costly legwork has been completed and establishes a remarkable concept. If a buyer wished to create a smaller dwelling, this should therefore be achievable subject to the usual consents.
As you will see, there are a number of CGI images to illustrate the proposed build and no doubt the buyer who presents will have a desire to create a high calibre bespoke home safe in the knowledge that the postcode supports high value transactions.
The sellers inform us that the property is Freehold
Council Tax is Band G - £3,628.51
St Andrews Road is located just off Links Road and Chorley New Road. The high calibre address sits within the heart of Lostock and hosts large individual dwellings, many of which boasting a significant value. As such a buyer can be comfortable in the knowledge that the tone of value within the immediate area is at a high level.
Many people would wish to settle in the area to benefit from the outstanding transport infrastructure which includes junction 6 of the M61 (around 2 miles away) and Lostock train station (around1 mile away) which is on the mainline to Manchester. Bolton School is also a consistent reason for residents to settle within the area and it is worth noting that a bus route runs along the nearby Chorley New Road and that the school is just around 2 miles away.
In terms of shops and services, Horwich town centre and the Middlebrook leisure and retail development include a great variety of outlets from small independent traders to large supermarkets, whilst many locals consider Manchester as an appropriate distance to shop, work and socialise. There is a choice of 2 golf clubs practically on the doorstep with a further variety of gyms and racquet clubs which serve the area. In summary Links Road has a great family friendly package on offer in what has long been regarded as one of the area’s leading residential zones and as such an early viewing should be considered essential.

A Perfect Blend of Timeless Charm &amp; Modern Comfort
Step into this exquisite 1920s semi-detached home, where the timeless charm of the era seamlessly blends with modern comforts. Recently renovated and ready for you to move in, this spacious family home offers three double bedrooms, two reception rooms, and a large kitchen with a separate utility area. Every detail has been thoughtfully considered to preserve the period character while integrating contemporary essentials.
The front of the property is framed by hedgerows, creating a private and inviting atmosphere. A paved driveway offers convenient parking for one vehicle, leading you to the front door of this delightful home.
Elegant &amp; Spacious Living
From the moment you enter, the warmth and charm of this home are immediately apparent. The porch features tropical Art Deco 'Grace Water Blue' wallpaper, setting the tone for the rest of the property.
The two reception rooms provide ample space for both relaxation and entertaining. High ceilings, period details, original doors and handles, and tasteful décor create a welcoming atmosphere. Large windows allow natural light to flood in, brightening the entire space. The dining room boasts deep picture rails, period putty-pink walls adorned with floral shabby chic wallcovering, a feature fireplace with a tiled hearth, and wide-plank timber laminate flooring. The living room showcases a wide bay window with views over the front garden, dark blue walls to picture rail height with white above, and a stone fireplace with a gas fire. The full wall behind the fire is decorated with Hestia mustard wisteria-style wallpaper.
The kitchen, located at the rear of the house, features grey painted cabinets, a white granite-effect worktop, a double stainless steel sink under the rear window with a view of the garden, plumbing for a dishwasher, and a white bird-patterned wallpaper. An original ornamental fire adds character, and walnut laminate flooring completes the space. The kitchen also includes room for a freestanding fridge/freezer, a separate cooking area with an electric oven, a 4-ring gas hob, and a stainless steel extractor above, with white metro tiles as the splashback. A separate utility room adds convenience and practicality.
Comfortable &amp; Stylish Bedrooms
Climb the stairs, passing a half-landing window, and you’ll reach a spacious landing painted in putty pink with burnt sienna Nouveau-style wallpaper at the head of the staircase.
Upstairs, three double bedrooms offer peaceful retreats, each designed to maximize space and light. The spacious front-facing master bedroom is decorated with bird wallpaper at picture rail height, bright green behind the bed, and plenty of room for a full set of furniture. The second bedroom, also to the front is painted in a vibrant orange with original floorboards. The third bedroom, overlooking the rear garden, features forest green to picture rail height and pink above, with treated original floorboards.
The recently refurbished bathroom exudes luxury, with a stunning roll-top bath and overhead shower, a glazed screen, a stylish wall-hung deep blue vanity unit, and a separate WC. The marble-effect wall tiling and Moroccan-style flooring tiles add to the elegant feel.
A Garden to Enjoy
The outdoor space is just as impressive as the interior. The rear garden is well-maintained and low-maintenance, featuring a large paved patio and dedicated vegetable and fruit patches for those who enjoy growing their own produce. A split-level patio area provides the perfect setting for outdoor dining or relaxing in a peaceful atmosphere. The garden is enclosed with timber fencing, making it ideal for children and pets. There is also a large shed that houses a motorcycle/bikes with a ground anchor inside for added security. This can be accessed from the front or rear of the property.
A Fantastic Location
Situated on a desirable street in a friendly, welcoming neighbourhood, this home is just moments away from an award-winning pizza restaurant, a charming deli, and a beloved coffee shop. Bolton School and local primary schools are within walking distance, making it a fantastic choice for families.
Exciting Potential
With the right planning permissions, there’s the potential to extend into the loft, as some neighbouring properties have done. There’s also the possibility of a rear extension, allowing new owners to enhance this beautiful home further to meet their needs.
This home offers the perfect combination of charm, comfort, and practicality in a sought-after location. Viewing is highly recommended.

Any fixtures and fittings not specifically mentioned in the property details should be agreed separately with the seller.
Anti-Money Laundering (aml) &amp; Buyer id Checks
To comply with legal requirements, we must verify the identity of all buyers before we can move forward with a sale. We’ll also need proof of funds and details of your instructed solicitor at this stage. At Newton &amp; Co, we use a trusted third-party provider to complete these checks securely and quickly.

Located just off Regent Road
The Home:
Our clients purchased this property just over three years ago from a family who had owned the property since its initial construction. Whilst the property had been well cared for during the lengthy ownership, aesthetically and layout wise the home was dated and subsequently a significant program of modernisation has taken place with a reconfiguration and an extension having now been completed.
The result is a stunning home with modern curb appeal by way of double apex roofline, neutral rendering and anthracite windows. The driveway has been enlarged to accommodate family sized parking whilst the garage has been retained. There is scope for further conversion should additional ground floor space or bedroom be required. The two primary bedrooms with their vaulted ceilings should allow this home to stand out from the crowd.
This truly is one not to be missed and an early viewing is recommended.
The property is Freehold
Council Tax is Band F - £3,318.18
The Area:
Morris Fold Drive is located just off Regent Road which is located within the heart of Lostock and is seen by many as one of the more prestigious roads within the area. A particularly strong feature of the road is access to Lostock train station which is around 0.3 miles away and links to Manchester and its airport.
Lostock County Primary School is just a few minutes from the property and the train station itself and many people buy within this area seeking good access to the private schooling on offer within the town (Bolton School is just over 2 miles away). Whilst the train station is well placed, Junction 5 and 6 of the M61 are also easily accessible. The closest commercial centre is within the out-of-town retail complex close to the Toughsheet Community Stadium at the Middlebrook retail complex which includes a number of supermarkets and large outlets together with gym, bowling alley, cinema, restaurants etc. There are also two golf courses and a tennis club within easy walking distance.
Many locals also consider Manchester and the Trafford Centre as an appropriate distance for both socialising and work. Whilst many of these features are ideal for living within a commuter belt of a large city, the town also boasts very popular countryside including a stretch of the West Pennine Moors and Winter Hill.

"Manchester commuter belt
Motorway and train link around 3 miles
Superb views to the rear
Deceptive accommodation
Impressive master bedroom with ensuite
Two cottages joined together
Good provision for storage
Modernised in many areas during recent years
Close to countryside
Large cellar room
A double fronted stone cottage which is a real break from the norm and offers accommodation that can suit a wide variety of family dynamics. Numbers 18 and 19 Bottom o'th Moor have been merged to create Spindle Cottage which is a large dwelling whose size is not so obvious from the exterior.
There is great flexibility of accommodation which can be utilised in a variety of ways. In summary, the layout is as follows; the ground floor includes a dining kitchen fitted with bespoke units and granite surfaces and three living areas. There is a large cellar room with regular head height that is used as a utility/store/boot room. The first floor includes two bedrooms (one with large ensuite) and the main bathroom. The second floor includes two further bedrooms and a store room. All the rear facing rooms enjoy the superb open aspect, initially over fields and then far reaching views beyond.
The property is Freehold
Council Tax is Band C - £1,935.20
Bottom o'th Moor is a high calibre address around a mile and a half from Horwich town centre and around two and a half miles from junction 6 of the M61 and Horwich Parkway train station. This station is on the mainline to central Manchester and Manchester airport.
The area manages to strike a lovely balance of these convenient amenities with superb access to the surrounding countryside and therefore the location tends to attract people who enjoy spending time outdoors whilst requiring the convenience of having transport links to a city.
There are footpaths leading immediately from the road with access towards High Rid reservoir, and the nearby Georges Lane is one of the main routes towards Rivington Pike and its associated moorland. Many locals consider Manchester and the Trafford Centre an appropriate distance to shop and socialise and is therefore another great attribute to the area.

Substantial Family Home Set In A Picturesque Location
Escape the hustle and bustle of modern life and rediscover the restorative charms of the countryside at Holme Fold Farm, in Farnworth.
A home filled with rich history, that is of the land, Holme Fold Farm is a true character home, brimming with original features including centuries’ old, exposed beams.
Dating back to 1830, this former farmhouse has so much potential; with spacious rooms, a studio annex and two independent cottages, its flexibility is limitless – from family home with ample guest accommodation to hotel, farm, smallholding, lifestyle business; the versatility of the buildings and 2.7 acres of land cannot be underestimated.
A warm welcome
Pull through the bespoke iron gates and along a lengthy driveway, where there is ample parking for at least six cars, before making your way to the porch entrance, where a multifuel stove provides a buffer of warmth as you step indoors away from the elements.
To the right, make your way into the sitting room, where an incredible carved wood and redbrick original fireplace houses a gas fire. Currently used as a study, this cosy room features handsome exposed beams to the ceiling, with quality, hardwearing carpet underfoot. On windy days, shut the door to the world and feel the solidity of the thick stone walls, retaining warmth in winter and keeping a cool interior in the summer months.
Wine and dine
Opening up from the sitting room is the dining room, where a traditional look, real-flame gas fire adds rustic glow. Deep set windows frame views out over the courtyard whilst beams overhead – sourced from ancient ships – infuse this characterful room with olde worlde warmth.
Conveniently connected to the dining room, follow the easy flow of Holme Fold Farm through to the kitchen, where original flagstone flooring adds authentic farmhouse charm underfoot. Practical and robust, this flooring is perfectly in keeping with the country-style cabinetry that surrounds, providing plenty of storage.
Traditional touches
Overhead, in the white painted beams, original meat hooks can still be spied. With plenty of space for freestanding appliances beneath the solid oak worktops, there is ample potential to update this kitchen, with scope to open it up to the studio apartment beyond, creating a modern open-plan dining-kitchen. Views extend over the cobblestone courtyard, filled with colour and planted with flowers, trees and shrubs.
Ideal for family living, room leads on from room at Holme Fold Farm, with the kitchen conveniently connecting to the front lounge.
A superbly sized family room, modern spotlighting balances against the original beams inlaid within the ceiling above. Warmth fills the room from the stove, set within a handsome exposed redbrick surround, whilst views extend over the front garden.
Bedtime beckons
Completing the loop of the home, ascend the stairs from the sitting room to arrive on the upstairs landing, where recently fitted pale grey carpets harmonise with the white walls for a calming feel.
On the left, discover bedroom four, a good-sized double bedroom offering incredible views over the front of the home, with fields unfurling as far as the eye can see. A sunny, south-facing room, catch the sunrise and sunsets from this bedroom, and spy deer roaming the dew-covered meadows.
Freshen up in the bathroom opposite, beautifully proportioned and furnished with a traditional clawfoot bathtub, shower, wash basin with traditional taps and WC. Resin flooring, impervious to water, is practical underfoot. Pale grey and white tones mingle with rustic black beams.
Coming out of here, turn right to arrive at bedroom three, another good size double framing views out over the courtyard.
Room for all
Opposite, the largest bedroom awaits, bright and airy, and following the same soothing grey and white decorative motif as the preceding bedrooms. Furnished in traditional fashion, this bedroom is a true sanctuary.
Further along the landing, sneak a peek at the fitted storage, before arriving at bedroom two on the left, a room with ample storage and served by its own shower room ensuite.
Overlooking the courtyard to the rear, also furnished with a soothing shower room ensuite, is a sixth bedroom. Dressed in white and grey, each bedroom and bathroom has its own fresh, contemporary feel.
Rental potential
With six bedrooms and so much space in the main home, consider the potential of the studio one-bedroom annex, one-bedroom cottage and two-bedroom cottage which also come with Holme Fold Farm; each furnished with bathroom, lounge and kitchen.
Ideal as overspill accommodation for large families, for Airbnb rental or even as self-contained business units, the potential is vast.
Outdoor living
Outside, a coal shed and cycle shed provide plenty of storage (an old-fashioned door in the rear garden, once used for coal deliveries is a hint to the 1800s origins of the home).
Six areas of garden provide different pockets of privacy in which to relax, unwind and appreciate the peaceful rural setting of Holme Fold Farm. Perfect for children’s games, a formally planted area accompanies a picnicking area with bench seating. Wildlife is in abundance, encouraged by mature trees and hedging, which also provide privacy and shelter.
Owner quote: “You could have your own swimming pool, gym or llama farm; all the potential is there.”
Make your way to the 2.72-acre field, a sufficient size for two horses, and survey the sublime surroundings. Observe the 320-degree open country views, taking in the distinct beauty of six counties, including snow-capped moorlands and sunny meadows. Watch the new year fireworks beneath a blanket and with a flask of mulled wine.
Additional outbuildings include a barn currently used for storage and a large shipping container, used as a lock up.
On your doorstep
Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside at Holme Fold Farm, surrounded by fields and where at night you can sit out and hear the bats flitting about, replaced by the piercing cries of buzzards in the daytime.
Rurality and refuge come replete with convenience and connectivity, with five supermarkets close by, the nearest only eight minutes away.
Dip into the hustle and bustle of the world with a trip to the cinema, only 15 minutes’ drive from the door, whilst the Middlebrook Retail Park is just over ten minutes’ drive away.
Families are well served by a plethora of local primary, state and secondary schools, whilst the independent Bolton School is also less than 15 minutes’ drive away.
Commute with ease; the motorway junction is only five minutes from the door – though you’d never know it. The vast greenery of Great Lever and Farnworth Golf Club provides a buffer between Holme Fold Farm and the Royal Bolton Hospital – a mere five or so minutes’ drive away.
Owner quote: “One minute you’re in a semi-rural world; the next you can be in suburbia surrounded by modern life.”
For those who love character properties and are looking for the flexibility to build their own life around them, Holme Fold Farm is a versatile oasis of calm, wherein you can escape the inflexibility of modern life. Not just a home, it’s a lifestyle; and it’s ready for its next adventure.
Agent notes:
 Important Notice for Buyers
We do our best to make sure our property details are accurate and reliable, but they do not form part of any offer or contract and should not be relied upon as statements of fact. Measurements, photographs, floor plans, and any services or appliances listed are for guidance only — they may not be exact or tested. Some photographs may include virtually staged furnishings and décor intended to illustrate potential layouts or styling.
Fixtures &amp; Fittings
Any fixtures and fittings not specifically mentioned in the property details should be agreed separately with the seller.
Anti-Money Laundering (aml) &amp; Buyer id Checks
To comply with legal requirements, we must verify the identity of all buyers before we can move forward with a sale. We’ll also need proof of funds and details of your instructed solicitor at this stage. At Newton &amp; Co, we use a trusted third-party provider to complete these checks securely and quickly. There’s a small, non-refundable fee of £25 per person (or £50 if you’re buying through a company), which is paid directly to us when you’re ready to proceed. Please note, we can’t issue a memorandum of sale until these checks are complete — so the sooner they’re done, the sooner we can help you secure your new home.
Relationship Disclosure
In line with Section 21 of the Estate Agents Act 1979, we must declare if the owner of a property is related to anyone at Newton &amp; Co. If that’s ever the case, we’ll always let you know.

Superb access to the surrounding hills and countryside

Rare opportunity to acquire a house within this cul de sac
Handy for day to day shops and services and Middlebrook Retail Park is around 2 miles away
Originally constructed and configured as a three bedroom home, our clients have since extended the accommodation to include a ground floor bedroom with associated wet room.
Level access has been installed by way of a side path and rear ramp.
As such there is four bedroom accommodation on offer with the benefits of two bathrooms or alternatively the rear extension could be reconfigured to create a larger open plan kitchen and living area or separate reception room.
There is an enclosed rear garden and garage to the side which currently has the garage door replaced by a window as the space has been used for a variety of purposes over the years.
Homes of the style within this cul-de-sac very seldom placed in the open market and an early viewing should be considered essential

Cooper Street is positioned just off Lee Lane and provides a superb balance of access into the town centre but from a cul-de-sac residential street. Houses on Cooper Street rarely come to the market due to the pleasant and convenient nature of its location. Many people look to settle in Horwich due to the transport infrastructure which includes Horwich Parkway and Blackrod train stations which link into Manchester and junction 6 M61. Horwich town centre offers a wide selection of shops, cafes and restaurants, many of which are independently owned, yet is also only a 10-minute drive from Middlebrook Retail and Leisure Park. For those who enjoy spending time outdoors the moors around Rivington Pike and Winter Hill are conveniently positioned and provide an impressive backdrop to the town itself. Anyone who has their search criteria set to good access to the countryside, excellent transport links and handy for day-to-day shops should look no further than Cooper Street.

Deposit
Sales can be secured with a reservation deposit of £5,000. This forms part of the final purchase price and is not an extra cost.
This deposit ensures that the property is taken off the market as soon as a sale is agreed. It is then exclusively reserved for you, eliminating gazumping, time wasting and financial loss.
An administration fee of £396 is required in order to draw up an exclusive legally binding contract between the buyer and seller. This gives the buyer exclusive rights to purchase within a pre-agreed timeframe.
Exclusivity
Following the payment of the above amount, Springbok Properties will facilitate a fixed exclusivity period (approximately 12 weeks). During this time, surveys should be arranged and preparations made for the exchange of contracts. The property will be reserved, so there will be no risk of gazumping.

To the first floor, there are four nicely proportioned bedrooms, the master of which includes an ensuite with the further bedrooms being served by the main family bathroom.

We understand that the property has not been extended historically which can make this process easier should further accommodation be desired in due course.

Motorway link around 1 mile
Train station around 1.5 miles
Mature well-tended garden
Ground floor shower room and first floor bathroom
Occupying a generous plot within this very popular section of Newbrook Road which allows great access towards the A6.
The property has been owned within the same family for just over 50 years and this immediate group of homes has been very settled over the years which is a great indicator to the quality of location and neighbours.
Benefiting from extensions to the rear, there are two reception rooms with the addition of a conservatory and to the first floor there are three double bedrooms served by the family bathroom. To provide extra flexibility to the arrangement there is a ground floor shower room which has also been added.
Externally, the gardens have been very well tended over the years and during spring and summer burst into colour. There is a sizable garage, workshop and a group of sheds one of which has power, water and is insulated which in the past has been used as a dark room but now functions as a laundry room.
Homes within this top section of Newbrook Road often generate speedy rates of sale and therefore viewing is strongly advised.
The property is Leasehold for a term of 999 (less 10 days) years from 1st October 1923 subject to the payment of a yearly Ground Rent of £5.87
Council Tax is Band D - £2,259.51
Set within the commuter belt towards Manchester with train and motorway links around 1.5 and 1 mile respectively. The home is located close to the A6 and therefore is ideally placed for access along the main road network.
There is access to out of town retail developments approximately 5 miles away plus the Trafford Centre is roughly 10 miles away and just a short hop down the motorway. The area also has access to more traditional smaller town centres such as Westhoughton, Horwich and Atherton. The area has long been regarded as a popular and convenient area to reside and will most certainly recommend an early viewing. It is worthy of note that the ever popular and independent, privately run Bolton School is approximately 5 miles away and it’s a feature that attracts many people to settle in the area.

A 4/5 Bed Detached Family Home On A Quiet Cul-De-Sac In Sharples
A Peaceful Retreat on a Quiet Cul-de-Sac
Tucked away at the end of a tranquil cul-de-sac off Belmont Road in the ever-desirable Sharples, this striking four-bedroom detached home offers the perfect balance of calm surroundings and connected living. “The Beeches” isn't just a name – it’s a lifestyle, set against a backdrop of leafy serenity and quiet neighbourhood charm
A Striking Welcome
With its warm brickwork, tasteful flower boxes, and a welcoming front entrance framed by a cottage-style canopy, the home instantly feels both refined and inviting. A spacious driveway leads to an integrated garage, providing plenty of space for family living or weekend visitors.
Step Inside – Where Style and Detail Meet
Cross the threshold into a hallway that makes an instant impression – stretching elegantly ahead and setting the tone for the rest of the home. Wood-effect tiled flooring runs underfoot, complementing the soft grey damask-style wallcovering that adds a touch of classic sophistication. Radiator covers add a neat, bespoke feel, while the staircase – complete with timber and stainless-steel handrails and a stair runner carpet finished with chrome rods – draws the eye upwards with a sense of quiet grandeur.
The expansive living and dining area is decorated in a calming white with a feature grey damask wall that echoes the elegance of the hallway. At its centre, furniture is thoughtfully arranged around an inset gas fire, with a recessed TV above, beautifully backlit within the chimney breast – creating a sleek, modern focal point. Timber laminate flooring adds warmth underfoot and effortlessly leads into the showstopping sitting room, where under floor heating awaits.
This glass-enclosed sanctuary is a masterclass in light and air. Large-format floor tiles, remote open and close Keylight skylights, and bifolding doors blur the line between inside and out – ideal for entertaining on warm summer evenings or enjoying a cosy night in as recessed spotlights softly illuminate the space. A statement twig effect wallpaper adds texture and interest, bringing the outside in and completing the tranquil, contemporary aesthetic.
The Kitchen, Refined and Reimagined
A perfect balance of style and practicality, the kitchen has been thoughtfully designed with modern living in mind. Expansive white marble-effect worktops provide ample space for cooking and casual dining, complete with a sleek breakfast bar, matching upstand, and splashback. The matt grey handleless units are subtly curved at the edges, offering a smooth, contemporary finish that pairs beautifully with the clean white walls and Moroccan-inspired grey tiled flooring.
Every element feels considered. Integrated appliances include an oven, microwave, drawer warmer and induction hob- all Neff, with a discreet downdraft extractor. Including a Siemens fridge and freezer and a Haier wine cooler. An inset sink sits just beneath the window, allowing for peaceful views while you prep. Under-cabinet lighting and recessed ceiling spotlights add both atmosphere and clarity, illuminating the space with a soft, warm glow.
A flowing layout takes you through to the utility room – fitted with matching cabinetry and flooring for a seamless look. With and integrated Beko double fridge/ freezer, plumbing for a washing machine and tumble dryer, plus a door to the garden, this space blends functionality with style.
Whether you're preparing a relaxed breakfast or hosting an evening with friends, this kitchen truly is the heart of the home.
Flexible Living – The Perfect Multi-Use Space
To the front of the home, a third reception room adds valuable versatility. Currently used as a stylish salon, it’s ideal for anyone running a business from home. Alternatively, it could make a fantastic home office, playroom, or even a fifth bedroom. Laminate flooring and silvery grey wallcovering create a chic, professional feel, while white walls and a large front-facing window bathe the room in natural light.
A Flexible Family Home
Upstairs, four beautifully presented bedrooms offer comfort, privacy, and practicality for every member of the household.
The main bedroom is a spacious sanctuary, flooded with natural light from two large windows overlooking the front aspect. A full wall of built-in wardrobes provides excellent storage, while the luxurious en-suite is finished to a high standard. A slate-effect shower enclosure with smoked-glass screens takes centre stage, complemented by textured feature tiling. The bespoke vanity unit houses a countertop bowl sink with an illuminated mirror above, flanked by fitted storage cupboards and a WC. Open shelving with integrated spotlighting is neatly built into the pelmet and plinth, while striking black and white geometric floor tiles complete the sophisticated look.
Bedroom two, also to the front of the home, includes its own en-suite and comes with built-in wardrobes, overhead storage, and matching bedside cabinets. The en-suite features a WC, wall-hung vanity basin with gloss-finished shelving beneath, a glazed shower enclosure, built-in storage cupboard, and beige-cream tiling for a soft, calming finish.
To the rear, two further bedrooms overlook the garden, both bathed in natural light. One is finished with a soft feather-print wallcovering and laminate flooring, while the other boasts a damask feature wall and plush carpeting, ideal for a guest room or a tranquil retreat.
Completing the first floor is the contemporary family bathroom – elegant and functional. It features a WC, a tiled-in bath with shower above and glazed screen, a wall-hung vanity unit with glossy drawer storage beneath, and an illuminated mirror above. The beige textured tiling and chrome heated towel rail bring a spa-like finish to this calming space.
The loft is accessible via a wooden loft ladder and is partially boarded, providing useful storage space.
Garden Escapes &amp; Alfresco Evenings
The south-facing rear garden is a beautifully curated space, designed with both practicality and pleasure in mind—a true masterclass in stylish, low-maintenance outdoor living. Every corner has been thoughtfully considered to create zones for relaxation, entertainment, and everyday enjoyment.
A sleek porcelain tiled patio is framed by chunky oak sleepers, offering a grounded, natural contrast and a rustic edge to the modern aesthetic. A low-maintenance artificial lawn provides a lush, evergreen centrepiece—perfect for children to play or for simply lounging under the sun without the hassle of upkeep.
Step further and you'll find a stunning composite decked terrace, complete with recessed lighting that twinkles underfoot as day turns to night. Built-in raised planters line the rear and side of the decking, bursting with seasonal colour and greenery that softens the clean lines and brings a sense of tranquillity to the space. This area is perfectly positioned for alfresco dining, drinks with friends, or simply unwinding with a good book.
In one corner, the garden takes on a playful, sociable twist with a bespoke timber garden room, proudly marked as the “Beer Garden.” Whether you’re hosting weekend BBQs, summer garden parties, or retreating with a nightcap beneath the stars, this is an outdoor haven that truly elevates everyday living.
Private, secure, and effortlessly stylish—this garden isn’t just a backdrop, it’s a destination.
