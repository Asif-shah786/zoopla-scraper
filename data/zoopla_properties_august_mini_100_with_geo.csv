Luxury 4-Bed, 3-Rec Detached Family Home Off Belmont Rd
A Modern Luxury Home in a Tranquil Setting
Nestled in a tranquil cul-de-sac off Belmont Road in Sharples, Bolton, this exquisite 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom, 3-reception room detached home is the epitome of modern luxury.
Meticulously renovated from top to bottom, no detail has been overlooked in this stunning transformation.
As you approach, the brand-new driveway and landscaped garden invite you in, with an impressive aluminium front door setting the tone for what lies beyond. Step inside to a breathtaking central stairway, crowned by a sparkling chandelier, where every inch of the home has been thoughtfully redesigned to showcase the finest finishes and cutting-edge technology.
A highlight of the home is the bespoke Venetian plasterwork, tailored by a specialist to complement each room, transforming the walls into a canvas of artistic expression. Every aspect of the property is brand new—from the meticulously crafted tiles to the bespoke kitchen and opulent bathrooms.
The home has been fully rewired to feature a state-of-the-art electrical system, seamlessly blending modern convenience with luxury. Most features can be controlled via smartphone, providing a contemporary, tech-savvy living experience. An efficient new boiler with a 12-year warranty ensures reliability, while underfloor heating spans the entire ground floor with individual zone controls for optimal comfort. This home truly embodies a perfect blend of artistry, innovation, and modern living.
Sophisticated Living Spaces
Step through the custom black door to your right and enter the elegantly designed lounge.
This space is the ultimate relaxation haven, featuring a built-in media wall with a luxurious bronzed polished plaster finish, complete with an inset electric fireplace, wall-mounted TV point, and recessed shelving on either side, all highlighted by spotlights above. The same striking marble flooring from the hallway continues seamlessly, creating a harmonious flow throughout the home.
A Designer Kitchen Beyond Compare
Spanning the rear of the home, the new kitchen exudes modern elegance, a space where sophistication meets functionality. Sunlight pours in through expansive sliding glass doors, illuminating the sleek, open-plan design and creating a seamless connection to the lush greenery outside.
At the heart of the room is a commanding island, draped in dark, veined marble that cascades in smooth waterfall edges. Around it, plush grey stools with gleaming gold bases invite conversation, blending comfort with opulence. Above, recessed LED lights sprinkle a soft, even glow, reflecting off glossy white floors that seem to stretch endlessly, amplifying the room's airy and luminous charm.
The cabinetry is a study in understated luxury. Its handleless design, swathed in dark marble with elegant gold accents, conceals integrated appliances including top-of-the-range Siemens appliances, including a coffee machine, two steam ovens, and a combi microwave. Every detail whispers refinement, from the clean, minimalist lines to the subtle interplay of textures. The kitchen’s polished surfaces and monochrome tones are balanced by the outdoors visible through floor-to-ceiling glass, inviting nature’s calm into the space. This is more than a kitchen—it’s a sanctuary of style, where culinary creativity and elegant living coexist effortlessly.
Striking Dual-Sided Fireplaces
Anchoring the kitchen and living spaces are dual linear electric fireplaces, each framed in a textured golden surround that exudes warmth and grandeur. Visible from both sides, these fireplaces create a stunning focal point, with their flickering flames reflecting the golden accents throughout the home. Above each fireplace, recessed alcoves provide ideal spaces for sleek televisions or statement art pieces, completing the sophisticated design.
New windows and doors, including sleek bifold doors leading to the private rear garden, enhance the seamless indoor-outdoor flow, perfect for both relaxation and entertaining. Phone-compatible spotlights throughout add an extra layer of modern convenience, allowing you to set the perfect lighting ambiance with just a tap. Every inch of this home has been meticulously crafted to offer a lifestyle of unparalleled elegance and contemporary comfort.
Versatile and Flexible Spaces
At the front of the ground floor, a third reception room presents a versatile space, perfectly suited as an additional sitting room, a playroom, or a private study for those working from home. Designed with flexibility in mind, this room adapts effortlessly to meet the needs of modern living.
All the bathrooms in the home, imported directly from Italy, are a true testament to luxury, showcasing the high-end Gessi brand. Thoughtfully designed for both style and practicality, each bathroom includes built-in storage and handy shelving, ensuring a seamless blend of elegance and functionality.
No expense spared even the downstairs guest wc is a vision of modern luxury. Polished white marble, veined with gold and grey, wraps the space in elegance, while a bold black vanity supports a copper basin that gleams like a jewel.
A circular backlit mirror casts a soft glow, its halo effect amplifying the drama. Slender copper pendants descend from a metallic-textured ceiling, echoing the basin’s warmth. The wall-mounted toilet, paired with a matte black flush plate, blends seamlessly into the minimalist design. Every detail, from hidden LED lighting to subtle accessories, whispers sophistication. A compact space transformed into a statement of artistry.
Luxurious Bedrooms and Bathrooms
Upstairs, soft silk carpet sweeps across the landing and into all four double bedrooms, wrapping the space in quiet luxury.
At the front, the main bedroom impresses with a sleek, integrated super-king LED bed—a perfect harmony of style and practicality. Neutral tones create a serene backdrop, while two windows, dressed with Venetian blinds, frame the view.
Step into the ensuite, where opulence awaits. Black and gold-veined marble tiles set the stage, highlighting a spacious double shower with LED-lit recesses. Contrasting white marble, a gold-accented vanity sink, and a WC complete this sophisticated retreat.
Bedroom two features a striking marble and copper-effect backdrop behind the bed, adding a touch of drama and elegance.
Its luxury ensuite continues the theme, boasting a grey marble-style counter topped with a sleek black bowl sink. A storage cupboard below offers practicality, while a double shower with LED-lit recesses and black fittings completes the space with a bold, modern edge.
Bedrooms three and four provide a neutral canvas, ready for your personal touch. Crisp white walls, soft grey carpeting, black skirtings, and wall-mounted radiators create a sleek, modern foundation.
One bedroom elevates the experience with a luxurious glass Juliet balcony, framing stunning views over Bolton—a perfect spot to soak in the scenery
The family bathroom is a haven of indulgence, featuring a freestanding bath paired with elegant copper floor-mounted taps. A provision for a tiled TV invites you to unwind in ultimate comfort.
Dual bowl sinks rest on a sleek black marble-style countertop, set against a polished wall backdrop and matching reflective ceiling. A spacious walk-in shower completes this luxurious retreat, blending style and relaxation seamlessly.
Indoor-Outdoor Living at Its Finest
Step outside and immerse yourself in a garden designed for enjoyment, day or night. In the summertime, open the expansive bifold doors to create a seamless flow between indoors and out, perfect for lively barbecues and relaxed entertaining.
The tiled patio stretches the full depth of the house, offering ample space for dining and lounging, while a sleek glazed balustrade adds a modern touch. Beyond, steps lead down to a lush, manicured lawn, providing a soft, open space for children to play and pets to roam freely. Fully enclosed for privacy and safety, this outdoor haven is as practical as it is inviting—a true extension of the home.
Prime Location for Modern Living
Tucked away off Belmont Road in the sought-after area of Sharples, this home enjoys the best of both worlds—situated on a peaceful residential estate while bordering the picturesque open countryside. It’s an ideal setting for those who cherish scenic walks and outdoor adventures right on their doorstep.
Families will appreciate the convenience of having High Lawns Primary School and Thornleigh Salesian College within easy walking distance. For leisure, local gems like The Wilton Arms pub and a variety of restaurants are close at hand, along with supermarkets and shops just minutes away by car.

Well stocked garden areas to front &amp; rear
No onward chain
A traditional garden fronted freehold property situated in a cul-de-sac location just off Manchester Road in Bury only a short walk to the town centre and all amenities and the Metrolink station. The property has been in the same ownership for the last six decades and of course in that time certain upgrades have been carried out to include combination gas central heating, upvc double glazing and a recently installed bathroom suite. It is prudent to suggest that a new owner will want to carry out further modernisation works to bring the property up to current day standards, however the property provides excellent potential for a new buyer to personalise the accommodation to their own tastes. Briefly the accommodation comprises: Entrance vestibule, inner hall, lounge with living flame fire, sitting room again with living flame fire, kitchen, first floor landing two double bedrooms and a recently installed bathroom with shower. To the outside there are well stocked garden areas to the front and rear.

This property has much to offer and has been very thoughtfully renovated both inside and out.
We would anticipate that many potential buyers will see the X Factor of this home as the large rear garden which has been thoughtfully landscaped and includes a number of outbuildings. Additionally, there is a long private driveway and front garden. This plot size would allow scope for further extension yet still allow the home to retain a large garden.
The accommodation has been reconfigured internally and includes a good sized entrance hall with access to a large ground floor storeroom which has been prepared to accommodate a ground floor WC.
There are two living areas both with access to a stunning modern open plan kitchen. To the first floor there are three double bedroom served by an impressive modern bathroom and please note there is also a large loft with two roof lights and the size should allow scope for conversion should this be of interest.
The sellers have expended a lot of time in maintaining the property which over recent years has seen the bathroom refurbished, new central heating radiators throughout, pointing to the front and rear of the property and an Indian stone patio being laid to the rear garden.
Early viewing is highly recommended to appreciate what this property has to offer.

"Set on one of Holcombe Brook’s most established and highly sought-after roads, this extended five-bedroom period semi pairs timeless character with subtle contemporary style. Just a short stroll from a range of village amenities and glorious countryside walks, it’s a home that offers the very best of both worlds — heritage charm and modern practicality.
Spanning three floors, the generous accommodation includes a spacious entrance hallway, large open-plan kitchen and dining room flowing onto the garden, two further substantial reception rooms, utility, downstairs WC, five bedrooms, two bathrooms and a storeroom. Outside, a private driveway, secluded sunny rear garden, and a versatile detached garden room complete the package.
Period Character &amp; Charm
From the moment you step through the original oak front door, the home’s heritage is evident. The hallway retains beautiful oak panelling and staircase, enhanced by statement tiled flooring. Period features continue throughout, from picture rails to open fires with cast iron surrounds, all set against a premium Farrow &amp; Ball colour palette. The current owners have done a superb job of preserving this charm while subtly upgrading the property to meet modern living standards.
Open-Plan Living
The showpiece of this home is the stunning open-plan kitchen and dining space created by the recent extension. A soaring vaulted ceiling, skylights, and French doors fill the room with natural light and create a seamless connection to the garden — ideal for relaxed summer living and entertaining.
The walnut breakfast bar invites Sunday brunches, while the quartz worktops and minimalist cabinetry keep the look sleek and timeless. A suite of Neff integrated appliances includes a dishwasher, oven and combination oven, five-zone induction hob with extractor, plus full-height fridge and freezer. Whether it’s hosting friends for dinner or enjoying busy family life, this is a space that works beautifully day to day.
Reception Rooms
Two further reception rooms offer flexibility for family life. The rear room opens onto the patio, making a wonderful summer lounge, while the bay-fronted room to the front is perfect for cosy winter evenings by the fire. Both feature traditional chimney breasts and open fireplaces, keeping the home’s character alive.
Practical Spaces
The utility room mirrors the kitchen’s modern styling, with extra worktops, storage, and plumbing for laundry appliances. An external door makes it ideal as a secondary entrance for muddy boots and dogs.
Bedrooms &amp; Bathrooms
Across the first and second floors are five well-proportioned bedrooms, four of which are generous doubles. The fifth, currently used as a home office, enjoys far-reaching views towards Manchester.
On the first floor, the front bedroom boasts a charming mullion window, while the rear enjoys a bay with green garden views. The family bathroom is equally impressive, with a freestanding bath, walk-in shower, basin, and WC set against coordinating wall and floor tiles.
The second floor is perfect for a teenager or guest suite, with a spacious double bedroom under sloped ceilings and skylights, plus an adjacent shower room with a modern three-piece suite.
Outside Space
To the front, a large driveway with EV charging point is framed by mature planting, giving excellent kerb appeal. The south-westerly rear garden is a true suntrap from midday to evening, with two patios — one for al-fresco dining, the other for lounging — plus a central lawn, mature borders, and fruit and vegetable planters for green-fingered buyers.
The detached garden studio, complete with power, lighting, and hot/cold water, is an adaptable space for a home office, gym, bar, or hobby room.
Location
Holcombe Brook is one of Ramsbottom’s most desirable areas, offering a warm village feel with the convenience of excellent local amenities. Within walking distance you’ll find independent shops, cafés, cocktail bars, country pubs and restaurants, along with everyday essentials such as supermarkets and healthcare facilities. Highly regarded primary and secondary schools are nearby too, making this a popular choice for families.
For leisure, you’re spoilt with doorstep access to parks and scenic countryside trails across Holcombe Moor and the West Pennine Moors, perfect for walking, running, and cycling.
